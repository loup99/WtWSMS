#Won Siege Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109047;We have won the siege of [From.GetName] and the survivors are at our mercy. These survivors still have quite a lot of supplies and treasures they hoarded while we sieged them. What shall we do with them and the holding we have captured?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109047;Spare the survivors and leave them alone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109047;Allow the men to loot, but otherwise leave the survivors alone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109047;Raid and pillage to your heart’s desire! This is a rare opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Generic Events 1 (25 events);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109101;I am extremely lazy, and I never want to do anything. Today, I don’t feel like attending to my official duties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109101;A nap sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109101;I think I’ll go eat some tasty food.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109101;The work I’ve already done is good enough, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109101;I’m just scared of interacting with others to be honest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109102;I apparently fell asleep while working hard last night. Perhaps I am overworking myself too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109102;Maybe I should take a break…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109102;No! I am not working hard enough!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109102;I will pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for strength.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109102;This is nothing, I feel as strong as ever!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109103;While looking for cheap merchandise at the summer fair, you notice a large coin purse lying on the ground. Nobody seemed to notice it, and its owner didn’t seem to be around. You are very much tempted to take it…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109103;Yes! Free money! All mine, all mine!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109103;I should find the purse’s owner and give it back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109103;I’m too lazy to take it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109103;In the name of justice, I can’t steal this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109104;While browsing merchandise at the summer fair, you come across a young, sweet beggar girl. Her plight moves your heart, and you wish to help her in whatever way you can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109104;Give the lass my entire purse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109104;Bring the girl to a local abbey, where the nuns will take care of her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109104;Bring her some of the food from yesterday’s feast immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109104;Hire her as a serving girl. She'll be better off this way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109105;Although I am suffering greatly from an ailment, I don’t really mind it one bit. Strange as some may think of this, I am absolutely content with my current situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109105;I’ll be happy, whatever comes my way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109105;This is will of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], after all!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109105;Bah, this affliction is nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109105;Everyone suffers, eventually. Why feel anxious about it?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109106;I want to improve my image as a [Root.GetTitle]. If everyone knows me as a great ruler, it will be much easier for me to achieve my ambitions. Thus, I want to be known as a great ruler because of…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109106;My glory and honor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109106;My good and benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109106;My piety.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109106;The fear I strike into the hearts of my subjects and enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109107;A silence enveloped the room when I judged the felon to death. It was a sentence I handed out on a whim, even if it was perhaps a bit harsh.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109107;He… he did deserve it, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109107;I’ll… I’ll just remain silent like everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109108;Throughout the land, the peasants are singing songs in praise of your just rule. Your capable leadership has made the realm a prosperous and affluent place.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109108;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109108;Justice is blind!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109109;Because of your notorious rage, no one in your court dares to criticize you for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109109;I rule my realm as I please.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109109;A good ruler listens to others. Maybe I should control myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109109;But… I want people to trust and love me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109109;In fact, my enemies fear me too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109110;Being a very patient person, I always try to hear others’ opinions before making a decision, because…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109110;Every opinion is flawed. Might as well hear them all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109110;Everyone deserves to be heard.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109110;I am such a great [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109111;I’ve started noticing that everyone is better than me. This isn’t fair! I want to be as good as everyone else – no, even better than everyone, rather. Why am I not the best in everything?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109111;I am worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109111;I don’t try hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109111;No one cares about me, that’s why.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109111;Maybe I shouldn’t worry about this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109112;An impoverished knight had recently died, leaving behind an orphaned child. I really feel pity for the unfortunate youth, who has no family left. I’ll try to find the child a good place to live in.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109112;Send the child to live with one of my trusted knights.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109112;Bring the child to a monastery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109112;Invite the child to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109113;You’ve made a fool of myself while sparring, acting like a full coward in front of the other men.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109113;I can’t help it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109113;I mustn’t embarrass myself like this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109113;It’s actually a tactical trick. IT'S A TRAP!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109114;Today while travelling in the countryside, a bandit or thug of some sort tried to ambush me, but I defeated the fool with my bare hands. He’s now sitting in my dungeon, awaiting punishment. Meanwhile, my court is praising me for my bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109114;Anyone could have done that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109114;All fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109114;Spare the man and release him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109114;I will torture him personally…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109115;I am such a pious person, indeed, but I have to prove my devotion to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] even more so. Perhaps I should fast every few days, even when it is not Ramadan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109115;All will know of my devotion!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109115;Maybe this isn’t a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109115;No need - [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] already knows of my piety.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109115;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] might catch liege's illness;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109116;I am no better than anyone. I can always learn something from everyone – even the lowliest beggar or the most foolish imbecile have something to tell me. Today, while surveying a nearby town, one of the peasants taught me a profound lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109116;Humility is the only way to better understand the world, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109117;An ugly wench is throwing herself at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109117;I don’t care who, I’ll bed any young woman!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109117;Maybe I should have standards after all…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109117;I can’t see her ugliness anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109117;When the lights are blown out, all women are beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109118;One of my new servants happens to be a pretty, innocent young maid, and I can’t get her off my mind. Some of the other men tell me that since I’m a strapping young man, I should accept my natural impulses, but I disagree – I’ve always tried to make sure I kept a pure mind, and I won’t yield, even now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109118;She may be pretty, but it would be a sin to defile her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109118;God will provide me strength against temptation!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109118;I can’t see her, anyways, so how can I admire her?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109118;I don’t like women, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109119;I’m hungry. What should I eat today?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109119;Anything I can get my hands on!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109119;Fermented mare’s milk sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109119;Hummus and pita bread for me, please.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109119;Fish and chips.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109119;Drizzle something with olive oil, now!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF1000109119;Did someone say baklava?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG1000109119;Pretzels! Pretzels for the pretzel [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109120;Some people say that my temperance prevents me from properly enjoying life, and I should stop being so prudish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109120;Such people are merely fools.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109120;Maybe they have a point.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109120;I don’t enjoy life? Why, I enjoy life all the time!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109121;I thought I just saw an assassin lurking behind the trees over there. A weird, dark shape, behind those leaves… is that a dagger? It must be a dagger!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109121;Wait… I’m just seeing things… I think…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109121;Judging from the angle of the light, it’s just a distortion of my shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109121;RUN AWAY!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109122;I’m such a gullible fool. One of my courtiers managed to play a prank on me today!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109122;I have to stop being so gullible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109122;I don’t mind at all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109122;Punish the miscreant with lashes!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109123;Over the years, I’ve learned to never show anyone my true self. I always have to deceive them, and manipulate them, and while I don’t know whether it’s the right thing to do, it’s a necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109123;It’s a danger when people know too much about you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109123;They wouldn’t understand me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109123;They’d think I’m crazy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109123;Nobody would want hear the voices in my head.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109124;While shopping at the summer fair, you realize that one of the merchants isn’t selling a lot of merchandise. After observing him for a while, you realize he is absolutely terrible at advertising his wares, and in your blunt honesty you criticize him for this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109124;Better improve at this, or you’ll end up a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109124;I’ll buy your products for you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109124;I have some suggestions on how to better advertise your goods…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109100;Some call me a tyrant, others a monster. But all my subjects fear me, and I think that’s a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109100;Blood for the bloody throne.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109100;It is necessary to rule effectively, unfortunately.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109100;I may be tyrannical, but I am fair.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Health Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109125;I have to visit my liege, who is currently ill, in order to conduct some official business. I really do not want to go near such a sick person, though - who knows what demons might be trying to possess my liege?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109125;However, I have to finish these errands anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109125;I’ll just not visit. I don’t want demons near me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109125;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] might catch liege's illness;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109126;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is visiting you to conduct some official business. While it is difficult to focus on your conversation, you manage to barely pay attention just as your headache and your cough get worse and worse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109126;ATCHOO! Oh... sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109126;[From.GetTitledFirstName] catches [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s illness;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109127;Your sickness lingers on, and it is difficult for you to do any of your normal duties at all. Instead, you lie in bed most of the time, sneezing and coughing and feeling miserable all around. You wonder how any work can be done when you’re in such a state.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109127;I wish I could get more work done!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109127;I can only pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] saves me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109127;Actually, now I have a good excuse to slack off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109127;No... I must... try to work... even if a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109127;At least I don’t have to deal with annoying people now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109128;A court physician is trying to administer leeches to you, in an attempt to alleviate your sickness. The learned man states that these leeches will help relieve the imbalance of the four humors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109128;You feel very weak afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109128;You faint from the loss of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109128;You feel nothing - this is just a mere wrist slap!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109128;You writhe and scream incomprehensible gibberish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109128;“Actually, the leeches should be placed here, not there.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109128;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] recovers from illness;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109129;I’m still sick, and now I’m even starting to lose my appetite. It looks like I’ll have to start eating gruel now to make myself feel better...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109129;Gruel. So this is what the peasants eat all day?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109129;No! Must... eat... normal... delicious... food... instead...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109129;Gruel? Please, sir, I want some more!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTTOOLTIP1000109129;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] vomits from overeating and makes a fool of [Root.GetHerHim]self;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109130;Because I am a leper, no one wants to go near me anymore. It’s quite depressing how my friends and family no longer consider me a person they could talk to, and this emotional pain only makes my physical pain worse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109130;Why must [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] make me go through this pain?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109130;It is inevitable... I must get used to it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109130;Finally, I can be alone, by myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109130;I just can’t indulge in sin anymore... just as [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] wanted...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109131;Despite all the excruciating pain you feel as a leper, you have come to realize that this pain only brings you closer to the love of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. You suffer for a reason, after all, and it has made you a better person, in a way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109131;I absolve to live a pure life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109131;I'll devote my time to studying spiritual matters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109132;Some days, you just don’t want to live. Leprosy brings you so much pain, from the moment you wake up each morning to when you sleep. Doing any normal activity, such as eating meals, attending to official duties, or getting into bed, brings you so much misery and pain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109132;All I can do is pray.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109132;But I still have to attend to my duties, pain or no pain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109132;At least I have my friends to support me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109133;You were just walking down the stairs, carefully measuring your steps due to your blindness. Suddenly, you accidentally overstep and trip, falling down the stairs in one big crash.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109133;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109133;It doesn’t hurt that much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109134;Ever since I was blinded, I’ve been worried that people might be trying to do things behind my back. What if that servant is actually an assassin with a knife right in front of my face? What if my spouse is having an affair under my nose? What if the peasants are mocking me as I travel the countryside?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109134;I better be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109134;My friends will be there to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109134;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will protect me from evil.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109134;Even so, no one would dare get on my bad side.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109135;It’s been a while since I was blinded, and I’ve had time to think about what this means to me. In a way, it is rather depressing. Unlike those who were born blind, and never knew of the beauty of the world in the first place, I can no longer witness this beauty - the vibrant colors, the rich and lush images. I miss my sense of vision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109135;This just makes me sadder and sadder...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109135;I have to try remembering what things look like.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109135;Perhaps I should sing or compose poetry instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Old Age Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109136;Some of my courtiers believe that due to my old age, I shouldn’t go hunting as much as I used to. Why do people keep insisting I restrain myself? I think I’m old and wise enough to make my own decisions, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109136;I’ll be fine, fools!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109136;Perhaps I really should cut down on my hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109136;I'll just make sure I won’t exert myself as much while hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109136;Undoubtedly [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will ensure I will not be harmed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109137;The young men and women these days bother me - they don’t seem to have the same respectable, moral behavior I had when I was growing up. They listen to unsavory music, sit and walk in promiscuous ways, talk with vulgar terms, ignore the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]... what has this world come to?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109137;I wasn’t an angel myself years ago. They’ll improve with time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109137;They don’t understand the hardships I had to go through!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109137;I pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will give them strength and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109137;Silly kids. They’re hopeless, useless imbeciles.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109138;Being so old, you know that your death is near - a matter of if, not when. Because of this, thoughts of the afterlife have preoccupied you for a while. What if you don’t end up with a good afterlife? A fearful possibility, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109138;Pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will help me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109138;It doesn’t matter either way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109138;I’ve lived a good life - what’s there to fear?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109139;Although I generally understand the [Root.Culture.GetName] the younger men and women speak, sometimes, they use exotic and foreign words that I simply don’t understand. The younger people simply tell me that I am too old to understand all this new vocabulary.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109139;I should make an effort to understand these new words!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109139;I should worry about more pressing matters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109140;As you grow older and older, your body gets weaker and weaker. The last few weeks have been particularly rough on you. You figure that your workload is causing you a lot of unnecessary stress, exhausting you and draining what energy you have.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109140;What? It’s’ nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109140;At this rate, I think I’ll get sick...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109140;I’ll just have to work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109140;I’ll try to get some help from others...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Byzantine Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109160;It turns out the Bureau of Barbarians was correct! After some investigating, detective work, and interrogating, it turns out the foreign merchant was a foreign spy for the Empire’s enemies! The merchant was hiding messages in the baklava he sold to other spies. Since the merchant operated within your jurisdiction, it is up to you on how to punish him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109160;Imprison him and send him to Constantinople for further punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109160;Let’s bring him to my torture chamber.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109160;Imprison him - I’ll also take all his baklava!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109161;Two of my guards are arguing about whether the Mohammedians or Latin Christians are better. One says that the Mohammedians, although infidels, are honorable and civilized like us. The other says while the Latin barbarians are indeed barbaric, at least they are Christian. Finally, one of the guards ask me, “What’s your opinion, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109161;The Mohammedians are better. They smell better, too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109161;The Latin Christians are better; at least they trust the Bible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109161;Neither. Everybody is flawed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109161;Everybody has their good points, whether Mohammedians, Latin, or Roman.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109162;While traveling one day, you and your entourage come across a small, ruined monument from antiquity. Upon closer inspection, you and your party determine that the marble columns and masonry must date from the era of Christ and Augustus Caesar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109162;Disgusting, these places of pagan idol worship!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109162;We should rebuild this monument here, as a symbol of my power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109162;Just as these monuments lie in ruin, so too shall our monuments lie in ruin one day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109163;Today, merchants from far away have come to the local market, selling delicious fruits, honey-cakes, sweetmeats, and other confectionary and pastries. In particular, the merchants are advertising their turkish-style baklava, a rich, sweet pastry made of layers of filo pastry filled with chopped nuts and sweetened with syrup and honey.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109163;I'll buy the honey-nut ones there, and the almond ones too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109163;I love baklava! I’ll buy all of it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109163;I’ll try just a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109163;The Turkish-style is particularly scrumptious. I’ll buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109164;Scandalous! I’ve just heard that one of my courtiers has taken an interest in Latin, barbarian fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109164;What a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109164;I think I like this style, though.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109165;One stormy knight, a knight-errant from the West comes to your castle. He claims he has left his homeland to seek fortune and adventure in the exotic lands of the Roman Empire, and has decided that you would make a worthy master. He thus offers his services to you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109165;I don’t want a dirty barbarian in my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109165;Very well! But first take a bath...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109166;You are attending a local feast with local officials, military commanders, and their families. Suddenly, everyone starts to join in on the Syrtos dance, a traditional Greek line dance dating from antiquity. Everyone is enjoying themselves, and you think about joining in the line.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109166;Let me join in too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109166;Interesting... but I’ll pass.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109166;That young girl at the end of the line looks very pretty...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109167;One day, you come across a large olive grove in your realm. The olives are the juiciest, ripest olives you have ever seen. Imagine what delicious food you can make with these! After you pay the farmer a visit, he explains his methods for making better olives - unusual and ingenious methods, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109167;I’ll buy as many olives as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109167;I’ll help the farmer establish more olive farms using these methods.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109167;I’ll steal all of his olives!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109168;A representative has come from the Bureau of Barbarians, an imperial bureau that handles security for any matters dealing with foreigners. The representative warns you that a baklava merchant in your jurisdiction is suspected of being a foreign spy, and the Bureau wishes to start investigating.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109168;Very well, go ahead with the investigation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109168;This is ridiculous. Go bother someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109169;The baklava merchant is found innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109160;The baklava merchant is found guilty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109169;It turns out the Bureau of Barbarians was wrong. All the investigating, detective work, and interrogating determined that the foreign merchant was innocent. You decide to meet this merchant anyways, to see what the fuss was all about, and you find him to be an intelligent man - a bit suspicious a character, but innocent of crime nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109169;Imprison him anyways - who knows what he might be hiding?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109169;Alright, let him go free.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109169;I will personally pay to compensate him for lost business.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109169;I like him. I need gifted men like him to assist me in administrative matters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Muslim Republic Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109301;One of our ships has returned to [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] from a foreign port with a cargo of coffee, a plant that can be turned into an addicting, stimulating drink. Word has spread throughout the city, and many want to try the beverage for different reasons. Perhaps I should as well!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109301;Only alcohol for me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109301;Coffee is a good alternative to alcohol, I want some!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109301;Coffee is a drink of sinners and conspirators.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109302;A well-known retired sea captain is staying as a guest of honor at our residence tonight. He tells of his great journeys across the world, in India, in Persia, in the far realms of China and Malacca, and the Swahili ports. I’ve learned much from his tales, and the tricks one needs to survive in this world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109302;I wish he could stay longer!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109303;Your dynasty has accumulated much wealth through its business ventures, and as such it might be a good idea to donate a small amount of this wealth to charity, as all good Muslims should.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109303;Indeed! I will donate some of my money.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109303;No, I earned this money.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109304;Today, a ship has come from the far east, bearing the ambassador of a powerful kingdom. He wishes to ensure that trade between our peoples is going smoothly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109304;I’m surprised they’ve heard this much about us!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109305;One of your business associates from the Eastern Mediterranean has gifted you with baklava, a popular sweet pastry from that region, made with layers of filo pastries, honey, syrup, nuts, and all sorts of other delicious ingredients.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109305;Why thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109305;Let us give some to the servants as well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109305;Get me more of this, my good man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109306;A Western merchant is currently staying in our city. While meeting with him, he asked me what sort of people live in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109306;We are a majestic and mighty people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109306;We are a pious and noble-hearted people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109307;Recently several merchants from the far east have been selling their luxuries in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] at discount prices. Perhaps it would be a good idea to take advantage of these good prices.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109307;I’ll buy the silk and porcelain from Cathay.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109307;I want those spices from India and Malucca.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109307;I prefer to save my money.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109308;While walking in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], a pickpocket has managed to steal all the gold in your pocket. You see the shadow of this pickpocket in the crowds of buyers and sellers, and know you can definitely chase after and catch up to this ruffian if you try hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109308;After him!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109308;It was only a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109309;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] chases after the pickpocket.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109309;You’ve caught up to the pickpocket, cornering him in an isolated alley, only to realize he is actually a small child, only about seven years or so of age.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109309;Give that back, you runt!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109309;Talk to him about leading a virtuous life and encourage him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109310;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] talks with the orphan.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109310;After talking with the pickpocket child, you learn about his heart-wrenching story as an orphan. But you admire the child for his intelligence and courage, as he tells you his entire story without fearing you or your entourage nor crying tears of self-pity. The world definitely needs men like him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109310;Give the orphan some money and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109310;Adopt him. I need sons like him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109310;Pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will help him.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB1000109311;Ow, ow, this hurts...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109311;STOP THAT RIGHT NOW! I’M YOUR MOTHER!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109312;Ever since I’ve been pregnant, I’ve been feeling constantly nauseous. The past few days, though, it’s been getting worse. I think I could be getting sick!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109312;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] give me strength!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109312;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] gets sick!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109313;My child is asking me whether they’ll have a little sister or a little brother.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109313;A little brother, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109313;A little sister, probably.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Hindu Courtier Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109314;As I’m gleefully dipping my bread into the delicious hummus at a feast, I overhear someone taunting one of my Hindu affiliates, mocking the Hindu for refusing to eat meat because of his vegetarianism. The Hindu turns to me and pleads with me to stop the insults.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109314;Come on, you coward, eat meat!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109314;Everyone must respect the Hindu’s customs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109315;While overseeing the unloading and loading of goods on one of my ships, I notice one of my Hindu associates conspicuously avoiding some of the harbor workers below. I approach him and ask him why, to which he explains, “That filth? They’re of a lower caste. I don’t want their impurities.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109315;You’re a terrible person!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109315;While I disagree, I respect your customs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109316;After concluding some successful business negotiations with one of your Hindu business partners, he has invited you over to his house. While engaging in good conversation, his servants bring you some Indian curry. As soon as the curry touches your mouth, however, your tongue burns from the hot peppers!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109316;Too spicy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109316;I... I like this... even if it burns! Agh!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109316;Chug it all down.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Childhood Flavor Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109317;The adults are so busy, they’re forgetting to get me my food. I want food! I’m so hungry! Why won’t anybody give me food?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109317;WAAAH! GIVE ME FOOD!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109317;I’ll just wait. Someone will come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109317;I’ll get my own food.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109318;While playing around with the other children, you trip and scrape your knee. It’s a small, minor injury, but does it hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109318;BOOHOO!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109318;I won’t cry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109319;Lately, after hearing the adults talk about this and that and this and that, I’ve started to get really curious about the world around me, specifically when it comes to...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD1000109319;The heavens and afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109320;I’m at a feast, and there’s just so many people! I don’t think I’ve ever seen this many people before in my life, it’s overwhelming. Still, there’s so many different people around, doing so many things - I think I’m starting to learn how to properly act...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109320;Friendly to others.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Republic Flavor Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109321;While walking in the crowded market, you feel something brush against your pocket. By the time you realize it’s a pickpocket, it’s too late. He runs off with your hard-earned money before you realize it, and he disappears into the crowds!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109321;My day just got worse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109321;I hope he finds good use for it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109321;HOW DARE HE!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109321;Whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109322;My best set of clothes is getting ruined, and there’s a ball coming up next month! The clothes merchant told me he’d be able to get a new set of dress clothes within that time, but what if I don’t like the new one?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109322;I’ll wait to buy the new one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109322;I don’t mind even the old, ragged clothes I have now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109322;Get me one right now, I don’t care about the price!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109323;One of my family’s ships has just grounded itself a few miles away from the city. We have enough time to save some of our wares and goods, but I’m afraid we won’t be able to save everything!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109323;Recover whatever we can!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109323;Men, make sure you recover these goods in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109324;Tonight I’ll be concluding a business deal with one of my new contacts, but I’m feeling uneasy as my religious convictions are getting in the way. If I go through with this deal, I might be committing a grave sin. If I don’t, I’ll lose the money I put into this deal already...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109324;Accept - why not!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109324;Reject and cancel the deal. I can’t do this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109325;A business associates has recently gone bankrupt due to a series of sudden misfortunes. He has come to you, begging for money. He says he can attempt one more business deal that, if successful, will allow him not only to pay his debts but also gain much profit, of which he’ll sure with you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109325;Very well. I trust you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109325;Sorry, I can’t. A desperate man will do desperate things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109326;The deal fails, and [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s friend gets into serious trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109327;The deal succeeds, and [Root.GetTitledFirstName] gets a lot of gold!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109326;Your business venture with your bankrupt associate failed! Not only did you lose money, but your associate will surely face serious legal consequences now. Because you supported such a risky venture, merchants everywhere might be more reluctant to do business with you from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109326;Dammit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109326;DAMMIT.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109326;Use whatever means necessary to reduce our losses!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109327;Your business venture with your bankrupt associate succeeded! Not only did your associate pay off his debts, both of you made much profit. As you both drink to your good fortune, your friend tells you: “I’ll make sure never to go into debt like that again. I’ve learned my lesson! I’ll never take risks again.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109327;I agree. It’s good to have some caution.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109327;No, no! Commerce is risk! Life is nothing but risk!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109328;I’ve misjudged the price of goods for the new shipment, and now I’ll lose quite an amount of money when I sell the goods to my buyers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109328;Why did I ever do that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109328;Convince my buyers to buy the goods at higher prices.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Holy War Flavor Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109329;While traveling with my troops during this holy war, I’ve come across a lost, exhausted warrior. He doesn’t speak my language, but my soldiers and I manage to figure out that he is an enemy infidel! Should I be kind to this man and give him some food and water, or should I do with him as I should any heathen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109329;We must show kindness and chivalry to all enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109329;KILL THE INFIDEL!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109329;Leave him to his fate and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109330;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] allows the infidel to stay with him and his men for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109330;Impressed by your generosity, the infidel - through an interpreter - tells you that he wishes to serve you. He actually ran away from his lord, who was an unjust, cruel man. The infidel states that he would rather serve a kind, just infidel than a tyrant of his own faith.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109330;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109330;No. Unfortunately, he must serve his own heathen lord.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109331;While traveling with your fellow ghazi, or holy warriors, you have come across a few Christian pilgrims. They are relatively undefended, and appears to be carrying quite an amount of things with them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109331;Leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109331;Give them some supplies. As Muslims, we must practice charity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109331;Kill them and loot their belongings! All infidels must die!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109332;While traveling with your fellow holy knights, I have come across the tomb of a local saint. As I am in the midst of a holy war, it is only proper that I pay my respects and ask for some divine aid in my fight against the infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109332;Pray for courage in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109332;Pray for justice to be served.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109332;Pray for all, even the infidels, to see the love of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109332;Pray that the infidels tremble and their idols be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109333;Although I’ve been known as a respected holy warrior for many years, I find it troubling that I still have some vices that can’t seem to go away. If I am to be a true holy warrior, should I not also be pure of heart and noble of soul as well?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109333;All have their flaws, and [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] understands this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109333;Pray for guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109333;Ask someone I know for advice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109334;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] prays vigorously for a while, before retiring for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109334;After praying for guidance, I have received a vision! An angel visited me in my sleep, telling me of the wisdom and mercy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. “Fear not, child, for you have true faith. Stay faithful, your greatest obstacles be vanquished.” With this reassurance, I think I can rest a bit more peacefully now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109334;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109335;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] asks an old friend for advice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109335;In your quest to purify yourself of your vices, you ask advice from an old warrior who fought alongside you during the holy wars. A wise and patient man, his words are encouraging as you expected. “Only [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows whether your vices will ever be vanquished. Stay faithful, and you shall be saved.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109335;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109336;Holy War is supposedly to protect the faith. But am I really doing the right thing? Should I truly be killing infidels? Even if they worship idols and blaspheme, they are still the children of God. They too are people, aren’t they?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109336;Infidels aren’t people, they deserve to die!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109336;We are merely protecting our faith.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109336;Men always have their excuses for evil things, myself included.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Lovers Flavor Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109337;You don’t like to talk much, even with your acquaintance. You just know the two of you, despite your mutual insecurity, seem to be able to communicate well without much talking. There’s no doubt both of you are very much attracted to each other. But you are young and bashful, afraid of rejection.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109337;I have to show some courage and confess my love!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109337;I’m too shy. I can’t spit it out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109338;My lover is quite demanding, so aggressive, so lustful - it’s quite difficult to keep up at night! Even worse, my beloved now wants to try out even more passionate things in our bedchamber. What can I do? Am I not really that satisfying?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109338;I’ll try as hard as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109338;Come on, dear, nice and easy - prolong the pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109338;I know of some exotic techniques from the far east...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109339;Even though everyone’s aware of our love, our chaste behavior is a source of mockery and ridicule. Just the other day, I overheard one of the servants laughing: “They can’t even hold hands, for fear they will sin!” I’ve got to do something about this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109339;I’ll to be a bit more physical...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109339;I’m happy with our love.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109339;I’ll spread rumors about my amazing abilities in the bedchamber.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109340;Smiling, your lover leans on you. Your world is at peace - all the worries and troubles gone, vanished, no more, at least for now. But this ethereal serenity is suddenly interrupted when your lover asks, out of nowhere: “I’ve been wondering, dear... why do you love me?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109340;You look so lovely.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109340;You’re a great toy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109340;You have a great personality.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109341;My constant public displays of affection with my lover seem to be getting out of hand, if one of my courtiers is to be trusted. This courtier had the audacity to suggest that we were going to far. “Touching, feeling, hugging, groping, and kissing in front of everyone - you must stop it, it’s embarrassing us all!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109341;We’ll stop it all at once!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109341;We’ll try to act more modestly in public.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109341;Now, see here, at least we’re not copulating in public!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109342;The two of us are widely known for being virtuous, good people. We both get along pretty well, furthermore. Why don’t we have a closer relationship to begin with?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109342;I’d rather not.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109342;I’d rather we become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109342;I need someone like that in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#African Flavor Events 1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109343;At the traditional Abyssinian coffee ceremony, you reach over for some salt and sprinkle it carefully into your coffee. Raising your cup, you drink the first round of coffee, called “Awel” in the Tigrinya language. The taste is bitter, yet soothing. Today’s coffee is perhaps the best in all of Abyssinia!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109343;I’d like some kollo with the coffee, please.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109344;Today you have a bit of spare time and decide to engage in idle talk with one of your courtiers. As you both walk outside, your courtier points to the the vast expanse of savanna outside. He asks, “There are many animals where we live, but I’ve wondered - which one do you admire the most?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109344;The lion, of course - who can match its regal power and prestige?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109344;The giraffe. It’s tall, like me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109344;The grace of the gazelle appeals to me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109344;The speed and vigor of the cheetah is amazing, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109345;The inspection of your troops goes well. However, one soldier in particular fascinates you - while your other soldiers only keep a few pages of the Koran under their armor (a typical West African custom), this man is stuffed with Koran pages from head to toe, looking ridiculous! Laughing, you tell him:;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109345;“Those pieces of paper won’t help you fight any better.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109345;“Admirable! You set an example for all followers of the Prophet.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109345;“Alhamdulillah! Why doesn’t anyone show true piety these days?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109345;“Be modest - Allah protects the wise and humble, not the proud.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109346;A man has come to your court, claiming one of your vassals has unjustly taken his cattle. As cattle are the life and blood of any [Root.Culture.GetName] family, this accusation is serious indeed. After some investigation, your vassal has indeed been found guilty! The impoverished commoner awaits your verdict.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109346;Pay back the poor man!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109346;Survival of the strongest, weakling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109346;Give the poor man some new cattle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109347;The witch doctor is quiet and attentive as you tell him of your recent trouble in trying to sleep peacefully at night. His voice is hoarse and dramatic as he diagnoses your problem. “You have ignored your ancestor spirits and the local deities - pray to them, that they may help you gain peace of mind!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109347;I will do that immediately! Give me instructions.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109347;Ah, I don’t really need to. Who cares?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109347;This is false idol-worship! Only [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] can help me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Generic Muslim Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109348;Before coming to the mosque today, you wash your face and your body as custom dictates. The water is refreshing and relaxing. The Prophet said, “Allah loves those who those who keep themselves pure and clean.” Clean and purified by the holy waters, You feel a moment of peace in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109348;How wonderful...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109348;It helps with hygiene too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109349;Today, a Sufi master has visited your court. While speaking with you, he criticizes you for your decadent lifestyle! He dares to compare his meager lifestyle to your “unnecessary” and “wasteful” lifestyle and suggests that you improve yourself lest you and your dynasty suffer grave consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109349;Who is this fool? Remove him from my presence!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109349;I must heed his warnings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109349;I just need to practice a little bit of frugality, that’s all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109350;For the last few weeks a well-known scholar stayed at my court. He has studied texts from the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, translated from the wisdom of the many peoples of the world - Greek, Roman, Indian, and Chinese - and has dispensed his knowledge to the learned men of my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109350;I hope to see you again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109351;The paper-makers in [Root.Location.GetName] are some of the most industrious and capable in the Muslim world. The quality and quantity produce here rivals that of paper produced in China!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109351;We can never have enough paper.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109352;Grinning, my courtier moves an Elephant piece forward, checkmating my Shah. Alas, I have been defeated in Shatranj (the Persian form of chess)! “What? How did you do that?” I exclaim. “That’s impossible!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109352;I suppose I must lose every now and then.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109352;HOW DARE YOU!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109352;What an educational experience.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109352;I let them win. It’s harder to lose when you’re trying to lose!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109353;Your great prestige and fame has earned you much respect throughout the Muslim world. From the poorest beggar to the mightiest Shahs, all know of your name and your deeds!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109353;It wasn’t easy getting there.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109354;Though you might not be the mightiest ruler in the world, your piety is to be respected. Men across the Muslim world admire you for your devotion to Allah, and religious men everywhere use you as an example to all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109354;Such is the will of Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109355;While reciting the Quran by memory today at the Mosque, you forgot a few lines! You stuttered and stumbled as you quickly tried to fix your mistake, to no avail. Finally, you had no choice but to look at one of your courtiers’ written copies. As a well-known hafiz, this comes as a big embarrassment!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109355;Everyone makes mistakes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109355;I’ll re-memorize it all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109356;I was having a pleasant walk through one of the nearby villages until I came across a young beggar girl. She keeps pestering me for more coins, even after I gave her some! The Quran may preach charity, but this beggar is taking the idea too far. She’s getting on my nerves - what should I do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109356;Give her one more coin, then run away as far as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109356;Fine, poor girl, have all the gold and jewels I’m carrying!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109356;Guards! Get this whore out of my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109356;If you want more, you need to give me something special in return...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Alcohol Flavor Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109357;One of my courtiers has challenged me to a drinking contest. I have a good feeling I can best the fool!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109357;Let’s go for it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109357;I do not engage in such dangerous behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109358;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] wins the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109359;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] loses the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109358;Gulping down the last mug of alcohol, you grin at your courtier, who happens to be pass out. Then, you pass out yourself. At the least, you’ve won the drinking contest!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109358;Wait... wha... MORE! YES! MORE!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109358;Oh... never again...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109359;Your head hits the table as you pass out, while your courtier chugs down another mug of alcohol. You’ve lost the drinking game!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109359;Wha... what happened? Where am I?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109360;This grape juice here looks delicious! But it tastes... rather strange...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109360;*Hic*;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109361;My ward, [From.GetFirstName], accidentally drank a whole cup of strong wine, mistaking it for grape juice!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109361;Punish the child for their negligence!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109361;Haha, that’s great.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109362;Today, a new shipment of quality wines from Italy and France have arrived at the local port. We’ll be able to sell these to the nearby taverns and inns for a good price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109362;Money, money, lovely money...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109363;Your courtier stumbles in, drunk again, screaming obscenities and random gibberish as you attempt to hold court. Everyone looks at the drunkard for a while, before glancing back awkwardly at you as they await your reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109363;Punish the drunk with fines.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109363;Haha, what a fool! How amusing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Food Flavor Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109364;Today, your personal cook prepared yet another meal by boiling. Remembering the derisive Byzantine maxim, “The lazy cook prepares everything by boiling,” you decide you might as well ask your cook why he is so lazy. Trying to look intimidating as possible, you approach the cook and tell him...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109364;“Don’t be lazy! If you work hard, everyone will appreciate it.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109364;“Some people might care, but personally, I think it’s fine that you’re being lazy.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109364;“Cook different varieties of food - maybe with garum or kefalintzin cheese?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109365;Today, a merchant from one of the eastern Mediterranean realms is visiting your household. To your utter shock, the man insisted that his servants cut the food up into pieces and then eating the pieces with this thing called a “fork”. These foreign manners are nothing but sheer vanity!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109365;Indeed! This is a mark of pride.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109365;We should respect different customs, even if they are rather arrogant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109366;It was supposed to be a delicious cup of kefir - a fermented milk drink originally from the Caucasus - but it turned out to be too sour. It appears it wasn’t preserved that well, and now you’re feeling a bit sick.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109366;Oh, my stomach’s revolting...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109366;I think someone’s trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109367;Today, one of your vassals is visiting you. As custom dictates, you must prepare the traditional North African mint tea for your guest in a simple ceremony. Thankfully, you manage to complete the ceremony with no blunders.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109367;My vassal seems to appreciate it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109368;While traveling to one of your faraway holdings, you must stop for a meal. You find a “guanz”, a ger or nomad tent used on the nomad steppes as a mobile restaurants as sorts. The owner of the guanz asks you what sort of meat would you like.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109368;Horse meat, please.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109368;Mutton, like everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109368;Goat testicles sound good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Elder Scrolls References Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109369;“STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!” the city guard yells, as you merely pick up an apple to judge its quality while visiting a food vendor. The guard, embarrassed, admits he was too hasty in thinking you were a thief, not even realizing that you were his lord!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109369;He was a bit rash, but better safe than sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109369;Ha ha, what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109369;Imprison him for a day - that’d teach him a lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109370;From your window, you gaze at the Muslim merchants who are inspecting the wares of your city’s vendors. Meanwhile, one of your guards, who had never seen Mohammedan men before, whispers in awe, “Do you see those men from the Orient? They have curved swords. Curved. Swords.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109370;Of course they do. Swords don’t have to be straight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109370;Did you know that Mohammedans like curved swords because...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109371;In your dreams, a dark, sinister hooded figure approaches. His voice is calm and eerily pleasant as he says, “You sleep rather soundly for a kinslayer. That's good. You'll need a clear conscience for what I'm about to propose...” The figure moves closer, and closer, and closer...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109371;No! No! GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU DEVIL!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109372;“Heard any good rumors lately?” asks one of your courtiers, while you two engage in idle conversation one day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109372;I’ve heard others say the same.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109372;I ate a muddied crab the other day. Horrible meal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109372;I heard a rumour that you're an idiot, is there any truth to that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109372;I do not spread rumors, I create them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Dirty Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109373;A big splash, and you fall into the mud. Dammit! If only it didn’t rain this morning. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to take a stroll outside, after all. You stand up, trying to wipe the mud off your ruined clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109373;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109373;This is the will of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], seeking to humble me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109374;While strolling outside one day, you stop to relieve yourself. As you finish, you notice a bit of gleaming on the ground. Careful to not step on your urine, you move towards the shiny object, and realize that it is a few gold coins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109374;What luck!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109375;Today I’m visiting some of the local peasants. Inquiring about their farming practices, one of the peasant men told me about how they are debating the usage of various fertilizers. “My lord, frankly, I’m not sure which one would help yield a better harvest - urine, feces, or dead plants.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109375;Don’t talk such rot, you filthy peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109375;Urine seems cleaner to me...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109375;Feces. It looks like dirt, maybe it’d work better with dirt?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109375;Dead plants make the most sense to me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109376;I’m observing some of the local priests at work studying dense and arcane ancient texts. Suddenly, one of the priests says, “Oh dear, this manuscript won’t do at all. The colors of the illustrations aren’t good.” Perhaps I should suggest a better source of pigment to illustrate the manuscript.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109376;“Earwax, I’ve heard, makes the best pigment.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109376;“Many have told me urine really brings out the vibrant colors.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109376;“Try looking for colorful stones to grind.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109377;You overhear one of your courtiers complaining about how, as of late, his feces has turned strange colors, like green. Then again, this courtier is known for being a complete pig, so who knows what sort of foods caused this amusing circumstance?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109377;That’s what you get for eating too much food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109377;I suspect that you might have too much bile in your body.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Nature Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109378;Tonight the night sky is clear, and you can see every single star shining in the sky like jewels on a fine, black dress. What wonder can be found in heaven’s creation! What magic! You have a rare moment of peace in yourself as you admire the night sky.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109378;Amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109379;A butterfly landed on my arm. It looks so harmless, just fluttering its wings, unaware of my existence.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109379;I’ll wait until it flies away.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109379;Shake it off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109379;Smash and kill it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109380;You’ve just made a quick trip to one of the local oases. While resting with your entourage on the journey back, you fail to notice a scorpion nearby - you accidentally irritate it, and it stings you hard! Your men quickly dispose of the creature while you squirm in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109380;Ow! Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109380;Thankfully, I dodged it just it time. False alarm!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Turkish Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109381;This year’s annual Oil Wrestling tournament, or Yagli Gures tournament, in our province is drawing an unusually large amount of spectators. What a sight it is, to see such brave and mighty men compete for glory! And so, the fame of our humble land has increased as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109381;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109381;Why don’t we charge people extra gold coins to spectate?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109382;While enjoying some kebab with your men, you accidentally injure your tongue with your sword. Some of your men can’t suppress their laughter at the sight of their great leader having accomplished such a harebrained feat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109382;Haha... ow, my tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109382;Quiet, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109382;Off with their heads!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109383;Today, while browsing some wares at the local bazaar, I came across two baklava merchants - one Greek and one Turkish - arguing about whether it was the Greeks or the Turkish who invented baklava.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109383;We Turkish created the delicious baklava, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109383;No, the ingenious Greeks must’ve developed this delicacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109384;The Turkish merchant laughs at the Greek merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109385;The Greek merchant smiles smugly at the Turkish merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109384;A little later, the Turkish merchant catches up to you, and offers you a few of his baklava for free. “We should be proud of our accomplishments indeed, my lord. You’ve made me quite happy today. Please, have some of my baklava for free.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109384;Thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109385;The Turkish merchant stomps off, clearly angry. The Greek merchant, meanwhile, bows out of respect. “Your humility is commendable, and sets a good example to your fellow Turks. Here, have a few of my baklava for free. Please, I insist!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109385;Well, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109386;I keep wetting my bed, even though I’m old now! One of my servants, a kindly old lady, told me suggested I should walk under a blackberry bush. “This was what the elders told me when I was your age, child.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109386;Perhaps I should try it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109386;I don’t need silly superstitions.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109386;Nothing will work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109387;While admiring the trees outside your residence, one of your courtier, known for zealotry and deep faith, remarks, “Admire any of those trees except the oak trees. They say the oak trees are the only trees who do not worship God because their leaves do not swing as much as those of other trees.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109387;Good point. I’ll ignore those heretical oaks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109387;Someone cut the oaks down and uproot them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109387;What silly superstition.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109387;I respect God’s creations, even if they don’t respect Him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109388;With a flick of the wrist, you swiftly move your hands, imprinting your calligraphic signature, or Tughra, on the paper. A passing courtier remarks at the beauty of your tughra. “The form is exquisite... look at those loops, so beautiful! And the artistry of the strokes!” ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109388;I am amazing, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109388;I still have much too learn.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109389;After a long and stressful day, you’ve decided to relax in your personal hamam, or Turkish bath. As soon as you enter, a tellak - the young, male, and non-Muslim masseurs who work in the hamams - helps you wash and scrub your body.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109389;This is what I needed...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Dream Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109390;Night falls, and you are quickly asleep as you rest in your bed. In your dreams, you see a great light, an impenetrable, heavenly light. You know not what it is, or even what it represents, but something about it brings you peace and happiness...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109390;Is [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] communicating with me...?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109391;The cries of fighting men, the splatter of red blood, the clashing of weapons everywhere... You scream and shout in your dream, unaware of your surroundings, of who is your friend and who is your enemy, swinging your sword without regard, lost in your battlerage and the hellish terror tjhat is battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109391;DIE! DIE!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109392;In your dream, you see a tall figure with a golden mask approach, coming closer, and closer, and closer... And then, you are suddenly awakened by your servant. “Wake Up. We're here. Are you ok? Wake up. Stand up. There you go. You were dreaming.“;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109392;What was that...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109393;You stand before your people, basking in glory, arms outstretched. “Rome is restored!” you proclaim, to the cheers of the crowds. And just as it quickly started, the dream ended, and you wake up. “That was a good dream,” you mutter to yourself. “If only it were true...”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109393;Long live Rome...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109394;Tonight your dreams whisk you away to the pleasure quarters of a foreign, exotic city. As you go into one of the pleasure houses, beautiful women of all manners and looks flock to you, wearing exotic, revealing clothes. They tug and pull at you, laughing, inviting you to the bedchambers. Is this heaven?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109394;Gah, begone, you hags! I shall not be tempted!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109394;Yes, my darlings, my pumpkins, come to Uncle -;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109395;The brothel scene vanishes away, and you now see nothing but clear light. A mysterious woman approaches - the light obscures her face and body, but you feel a sense of ease around her. “Blessed are you who upholds such chastity. You honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] with your strength.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109395;I... what...?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109396;The beautiful women suddenly turn into hideous monsters of all shapes and sizes - crooked fangs, blood-red eyes, dark green skin of ooze and rot, claws like knives. You try to scamper away, screaming, to no avail - they turn on you, their prey.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109396;AARRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109395;Reject these tempting seductresses;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109396;Have fun with these beauties;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Zoroastrian Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109397;You read through the Gathas, the Zoroastrian holy text. So it says: “Brilliant things instead of weeping will be the reward for the person who comes to truth.” [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] be praised, what inspiring words!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109397;I seek to only be truthful in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109397;I will continue being truthful in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109398;The other day, one of my courtiers was gifted some Greek delicacies called baklava. I couldn’t help myself - I wanted to try just one, but before I knew it, I ate them all, and now my courtier is wondering where they went. The Prophet Zoroaster preaches truth, but is it really a good idea to confess my crime?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109398;I will confess. Honesty is the best policy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109398;I’ll confess. Since I’m the [This.GetTitle], no one will get angry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109398;I’m sure [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] won’t mind if I lie once.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109399;It was supposed to be a normal ritual. Standing by the fire with the priests, you were praying faithfully to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] when you coughed. You saw filthy spit fly into the holy fire! No one noticed, thankfully, but you feel great unease - you, a true Zoroastrian, defiled the purest of things, fire!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109399;I should warn everyone that the fire is contaminated with death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109399;No one will notice...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109400;Trimming my nails was such a bother! I, as a good follower of Ahura Mazda and the truth, quickly ordered my servants to dispose my toenail residue as soon as possible - they are considered dead material, so their impurity might cause inconvenience.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109400;Hurry, my servants! Get rid of it, and then purify yourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Battle Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109401;Suddenly, in the midst of battle, an arrow flies out of nowhere and hits you. Though the wound is light, and the arrow easily removed, it is nevertheless painful. Some of your guards rush around and pull you to safety. One asks, “What happened? Where did the arrow hit?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109401;I took an arrow... in the... knee... Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109402;In the middle of the battle, an enemy arrow hits one of your cavalryman’s horses. The horse crashes down before dying, but thankfully the rider seems unharmed. You come over to see how he is. “Dammit!” he says, “I got that overpriced horse armor for nothing! Worthless horse armor!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109402;Better luck next time, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109403;You hack at the enemy soldier, who falls down, dying. The man shouts “I yield, I yield!” As you take a step back in hesitation, he suddenly lunges at you. Thankfully, you react barely in time, and finish him off with one fell swoop.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109403;If he surrendered, I would’ve spared him... what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109403;Mercy is for the weak, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109404;“Arrows! Arrows everywhere!” your men shout, as they point to the sky. A whole volley of arrows fly at your troops - so many that they seem to be blotting out the sun it seems. “Brace yourselves!” you shout at them, as you raise your own shield, “Protect your heads, bodies, knees - any vulnerable spots!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109404;Watch your heads and bodies... and knees!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109405;An arrow hits you right in the knee in the midst of the battle. Thankfully, your armor was more than adequate in protecting you, and you bend down to remove the arrow. As you are just finishing, however, an enemy warrior lunges at you, and you have only a split second to make a decision before you...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109405;Raise your weapon at him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109405;Lurch and dodge to the side.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109406;Curses! Your horse was wounded and killed, and you have fallen down. As you come to your senses, you hear some of your men shouting, “The [This.GetTitle] is down!” Some are even panicking, “Is our [This.GetTitle] dead?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109406;“I’m alive! I am here! I am alive!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109407;In the morning before today’s battle, your men captured some enemy scouts. They ask you what to do with these unfortunate wretches?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109407;Let them go... after the battle is finished, that is.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109407;Imprison them, insignificant as they might be.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109407;Kill them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109408;It is the beginning of the battle, and your men face the enemy, ready for a fight. As you go around inspecting your troops, you happen to engage in conversation with one of your troops, a young, inexperienced squire. As this is his first battle, he is afraid, but also anxious to prove himself. You advise him:;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109408;Being afraid is normal - just don’t let it rule you. Trust in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109408;Blood, blood everywhere. Brace yourself for that sight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109408;The enemy are men too. Fight mercifully and honorably against them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109408;Kill, or be killed. Remember that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109409;“Curses!” You trip and fall down right in the midst of battle. A nearby enemy notices and takes advantage of the situation. He raises his spear, but just at the last moment, one of your soldiers jumps in between - he is impaled and killed, but gives you enough time to get to your feet and kill the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109409;What a brave man, to sacrifice himself for his [This.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109410;The enemy warrior thrusts at you, but you manage to dodge his attack. Now is the perfect time to strike, when the unfortunate man is vulnerable! “Haha, take that!” you shout, before finishing him off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109410;That was a lucky one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Wafrica Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109411;Caught unaware, I was hit in the chest with an arrow. But I am fortunate, for today I decided on whim to stuff my battle dress with an unusually large number of pages from the Quran, like many West African warriors. Thanks to the Quran, the arrow stopped a mere nail-length from my heart!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109411;The Greatest is on our side! See how he has spared me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109412;Blood, blood everywhere! You have fought against the enemy for hours, with no clear victor in sight. But your Griot - always by your side, even in battle - brings words of encouragement. “Be unstoppable like the heroes of old - fight, and I will be at your side to encourage you and your warriors!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109412;We will defeat our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109413;A member of my “Ton,” the fraternal order I joined in my youth, has fled to my court. “I’ve fled as I have angered my village head. I request shelter for a while.” After talking with the man for a while, I find him rather annoying - maybe there was a reason why he fled? All my courtiers hate him too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109413;We should be kind even to people we do not like.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109413;He will have to fend for himself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109414;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] harbors the member of [Root.GetHerHis] Ton.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109414;Days have passed since the member of my Ton arrived. Now his village head has come, angry. He and my new “friend” argue for hours about some petty matter. So this was what the situation was all about? Unsurprising, given the unlikable personality of my “friend.” I can’t believe this all started over nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109414;I should ask my Griot to intervene - it is only proper.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109415;My Griot tries to arbitrate the argument.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109415;My Griot successfully mediated the two men’s disagreement. The member of my Ton has agreed to stay with me for now, as part of the agreement between him and his village head. That certainly ended more quickly than I expected - what a good Griot I have! Unfortunately my new “friend” will stay with me...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109415;And he’s still annoying...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109416;A member of the Dyula class of merchants has returned from one of his usual trips abroad. “Praise be to Allah,” he proclaims, as he shows you the wares he bought - salt, for instance, and other such things. He offers you some salt as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109416;Thank you very much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109416;I wish to present the gift to my Griot instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109417;A thief was caught, trying to illegally trade gold dust within my realm. As gold is the exclusive property of the [Root.GetTitle], this crime carries with it severe punishments. The condemned man is brought before me to await his punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109417;Treat like all thieves - chop off his right hand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109417;Execute him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109417;Release him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109418;An Arab traveller, who has traversed much of Africa and the Middle East, has come to visit your court. Hoping to impress your guest, you present him with good food and gifts. Later, along with your Griot, you all engage in pleasant conversation, and learn much about each others’ homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109418;Haha! There are women elsewhere who fear showing their breasts?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109419;My Griot is about to deliver a sermon of sorts to my courtiers, emphasizing obedience and loyalty to me, the [Root.GetTitle]. “Perhaps I should focus on some positive quality you possess,” he suggests.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109419;Speak of my might and authority.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109419;Tell them about being kind instead of about me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109419;Focus on justice and order.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109419;The faith I show - talk about that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109420;I’ve heard of a well-renowned, retired scholar who once taught at the University of Sankore. He is a gifted man, skilled in letters and knowledgeable about any subject, be it astronomy or history, poetry or theology. Yet it seems his means of living are meager -  perhaps I should help him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109420;Send him a few gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109420;Give him a good pension for the rest of his life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109421;One of my courtiers has challenged me to Oware, a popular West African “mancala” game where players try to count and capture the most seeds inside several pits on the game board. My courtier says, “You were quite clever when you won the other day, but I’ll capture more seeds than you this time!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109421;Very well! I’ll beat you again!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109421;No, not today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109422;Let’s gather some seeds and set up the board then...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109422;“Hmm... well, that seed will go there, then,” my courtier says, making a move, as my courtier and I continue our game of Oware. Just what I expected - I might win yet again! Chuckling, I say, “A clever move, a clever move, but be careful - perhaps that is not clever enough. Now I will...”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109422;I will sow my seeds here, and capture those...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109423;My plan backfires, and my courtier wins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109424;My plan succeeds, and I win yet again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109423;“Haha! I have won this game!” my courtier shouts in jubilation, as I gaze, dumbfounded, at the Oware board. How? How is this possible? I planned my moves perfectly... but in the end my courtier captured more seeds than me. A bad miscalculation on my part, perhaps, and a valuable lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109423;Good game. You deserved the victory.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109424;With a sweep of my hands and a grin on my face, I capture the last of the seeds. Once more, I win! But my courtier proved to be a much more versatile opponent this time. “You played well, definitely. We should play more often.” To which my courtier replies, “Of course - why don’t we play another game now?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109424;Why not.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Celtic Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109425;While visiting today, one of your bishops shows you a beautiful illuminated manuscript he found at a local abbey near his diocese. “The monks told me it was saved by one of their resourceful predecessors during a Norse raid. I thought you should have it.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109425;Why, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109425;Good, good... I’ll go study this, it looks interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109425;I think you should have it, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109426;I thought I saw something unusual while out taking a walk to day. Lo and behold, it was a four-leaf clover! What should I do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109426;Keep it for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109426;I should give it to my spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109426;Show it to my children.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109427;Today during court, two youths are brought in before me. They got heavily drunk the other day, and one dared to shave the hair of the other! Long hair is of utmost important in [Root.Culture.GetName] society, so this is quite a serious offense. The typical punishment is to make the offender pay two cows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109427;Two cows it is.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109427;Why don’t we imprison the offender instead?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109428;It’s time to play Hurling! The object of this traditional Gaelic sport is to use wooden sticks called Hurley to hit a small ball, called a sliotar, into the opposing team’s goalposts. You gather your team of fifteen men (including yourself) and face one of your courtier’s teams.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109428;We shall have a good game!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109429;Your team loses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109430;Your team wins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109429;You and the men had a good game of Hurling, even though you lost. You can still hear the sound of the hurleys hitting the sliotar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109429;We should do this again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109430;Victory! At the last moment, you and your men managed to get the sliotar into the opposing team’s goalpost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109430;Well played everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109431;In the midst of battle, you start dueling with another warrior. Suddenly, however, you notice the leek he is wearing on his helmet. “By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!” you shout, “We’re on the same side, fellow Welshman!” Embarrassed, the two of you apologize before resuming fighting together.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109431;You fight very well, you know? I could use men like you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Ancient Cultures Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109432;In an isolated village of your realm, laborers digging irrigation ditches have discovered a cover stone engraved with ancient hieroglyphs. Under it is a great ring with strange symbols on it. Superstitious locals say it is a doorway to other worlds, from which came pagan “gods” to enslave the people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109432;Blasphemy! Bury this relic of the pagan gods and never speak of it again!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109432;Interesting... you know, this would look fantastic in my palace...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109432;This would make an excellent fountain for the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109433;Some peasants have discovered the ruins of an old Roman templewhile digging in their fields. While most of the temple is ruined beyond repair, the peasants discovered the statue of some pagan goddess. It is beautiful beyond description and lifelike - the statue looks like it could move at any moment!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109433;Bring it to my bedchamber... and some tissues, since I have, um, a cold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109433;Destroy that heathen statue!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109433;It would make a nice decoration in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109433;I should study it... such craftsmanship!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109434;While traveling on some official business, you and your men come across an ancient monument from before the time of Mohammed and even Jesus. The wisest of your companions tells you that this monument probably came from the Heroic Age, during the time of great men like Rostam and Esfandiyar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109434;So this is even more ancient than our Sassanid forebears...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109434;The Persian “heroic age”, you say? I am not Persian, so tell me about this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109435;My little excursion into the steppes is interrupted when I notice some gold on the ground. Digging more deeply, I find a burial mound full of gold art and jewelry. Perhaps this was left over by one of the ancient steppe peoples, like the Scythians?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109435;I see a gold comb... a gold dagger... a gold figurine...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109436;Traveling through the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan on some official business you see large, ancient statues carved into the mountainside some distance ahead. One of your companions says, “The locals call it Sork-bot and keng-bot - the red idol, the white idol, as they were worshipped by the Buddhists.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109436;What an impressive sight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109436;The disgusting things heathens do to beguile the masses!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109437;The large stones that dot my realm’s landscape - called “henges” - have always puzzled me. Today, a learned scholar is visiting my court, and I asked him about them. “The henges are ancient monuments built by the pagans of the British isles and France ages ago,” he tells me. “You see, the...”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109437;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109437;I notice they seem to be astrologically aligned, can you explain that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109438;Near one of the villages is a large stele, dating back centuries, when the great Kingdom of Axum ruled the region. News has come to your court, however, that this stele has recently collapsed, leading to some property damage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109438;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109438;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] that Christian absurdity is destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Sounds Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109439;“Allahu Akbar, Ash-hadu an-la ilaha illa llah...” The muezzin calls faithful Muslims to prayer. You are about to stand up and leave, but halt when you realize you have a lot of work to finish today. You’ve already done four of the daily prayers... maybe skipping one wouldn’t be that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109439;No, I must do my duty as a Muslim. I can always finish work later.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109439;I have too much work, I’ll have to skip this one time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109440;I can’t fall asleep quickly at night. I just can’t. There’s so many distracting noises - night guards walking around, animals outside making noises, the things I think inside my head... When will it stop?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109440;Gargh! I’ll try closing my eyes again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109440;I think I’ve just figured out a way to make an earplug...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109441;Today my friends and I got hold of some of the court musicians’ instruments, and we’re banging and bonging and making loud noises!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109441;Rock on!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109442;Your ward, [From.GetFirstName], was caught playing around with the court musicians’ instruments, making loud noises and disturbing the peace. “They’re rocking and rolling all over the place,” one of your servants complains. “What should we do with them?” You approach your ward and say...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109442;“I don’t mind it much, just do it elsewhere as to not bother others.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109442;“This demonic rocking and rolling or whatever will lead you astray!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109443;I was just having fun, smashing away at the court musicians’ instruments with my friends, when my guardian has told me, “I don’t mind it much, just do it elsewhere as to not bother others.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109443;Hey guys, I know a good place in the castle basement...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109444;I was just having fun, smashing away at the court musicians’ instruments with my friends, when my guardian has told me, “This demonic rocking and rolling or whatever will lead you astray!” before subsequently using the strap on me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109444;I better not try that again...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109444;I’ll just do it in secret!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109445;Lately, in the morning, you’ve snuck out of your residence with a few trusted bodyguards, to walk the beaches and smell the fresh ocean breeze at dawn. There is something amazing when you heard the waves crashing on the sand, the sound of pure, raw, natural energy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109445;But now I better get back home...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109446;Hammers, anvils, wood, footsteps, bleating, beating, shouting, ships, waves, stones, coins, grabbing, crashing, smashing, ropes boxes, barrels... there’s so many sounds and sights around the docks. “How do we do it?” one of the workmen say, when you ask them. “We just got used to it.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109446;The things you fellows go through every day...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109446;There’s a reason why inferiors work here, unlike me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109447;A strange noise! What... what is it? “Oh, what is it widdle [Root.GetFirstName]?” my nanny says. “What ish that? It’s a dog. You wuv dogs, don’t you? Dogsh saw bow-wow...”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109447;Bow-wow...;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Finnish Pagan Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109448;It is almost time to go on a normal hunt for small game. Before you start, however, you utter some prayers to Mielikki, goddess of the forests and the hunt, for good luck.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109448;O Mielikki...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109449;It is indescribably beautiful, and here it is, before my eyes - a reindeer, of pure, white fur. Nay, this cannot be any reindeer, this is most certainly a sacred reindeer. I signal my fellow hunters to put down our weapons. We cannot harm such a majestic, sacred creature, and we let it pass by in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109449;How amazing...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109450;It is only one word, but everyone hears it nevertheless. Today you’ve gotten just a bit too drunk, and you start using the common word for “bear” in your alcohol-induced ramblings. Saying “bear” in a non-religious context is nothing short of sacrilege!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109450;Whoops... sorry, bear - I mean, sorry, one with rough fur!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109451;The smith offers you a new belt knife, crafted in the traditional manner of the Uralic peoples, with a handle of birch and a sheath made of reindeer leather. This one should be useful for hunting, wood chopping, or just showing off, among other things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109451;Much appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109452;Your mouth waters as the tasty Mustamakkara is brought before you during the small feast you’re holding for a foreign dignitary. A mix of pork, pig blood, crushed rye and flour stuffed into animal intestines... delicious, delicious! You offer some to the foreign dignitary, who looks like he might vomit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109452;More for me, then.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109453;Today I’ve decided to be adventurous and explore a part of the forest near my residence I rarely go into. While admiring the breathtaking scenery I stumble upon an oddly-shaped stone Seita (sacred sites used by a clan). I do not know what clan this one belonged to, but I pay my respects nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109453;An offering of lovely flowers and herbs should do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109454;You spot your Shaman nearby, troubled, clearly lost in thought. When you ask what the matter is, your Shaman replies that a local commoner is gravely ill and that there’s not much that can be done. This man tended to curse a lot, and the Väki Haltija or nature spirits got very angry and caused his illness.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109454;I’m sure you’ll be able to negotiate with these spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109454;These Haltija are always angry about one thing or another.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109454;This is what people get for being so immoral!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109455;This year a few of my livestock are infertile for some reason. My Shaman tells me why: “It appears the Haltija or guardian spirits of another family were sent to trouble you, though they’re gone for now. Perhaps you should make yourself a better person, to attract less enemies next time?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109455;Don’t go on another rant about spirituality.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109455;Maybe I can try to reform myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109455;My enemies should be the ones feeling pain!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109456;I have a bad headache, so I come to my Shaman who hopefully will be of help. “I did go swimming recently, but nothing else interesting,” I say. My Shaman nods wisely, “It appears a water Haltija likes you and is attached to you. Make some offerings to it and politely ask it to not bother you.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109456;Alright, I’ll try that then. These guardian spirits are really something...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Prayer Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109457;“No, no, no,” my nanny tells me. “That’s not how you pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. Let’s try again, alright? Repeat after me...”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109457;Not these silly words again...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109457;Tell me again!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109458;I sit in the local Church during the Bishop’s sermon, tired and weary. Why is the world such a cruel, terrible place? The voice of the preaching Bishop fades away, as I begin to focus elsewhere. I begin to pray to God, to pray for forgiveness of my sins, to pray that I may enjoy life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109458;Father in the heavens above...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109459;I sit in the local Mosque during the sermon, tired and weary. Why is the world such a cruel, terrible place? The voice of the preacher fades away, as I begin to focus elsewhere. I begin to pray to the Greatest, to pray for forgiveness of my sins, to pray that I may enjoy life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109459;Allah, most merciful, most compassionate...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109460;There is a temporary lull in the fighting, a moment of peace. I find a small corner on the battlefield to rest for a few moments. I decide to offer a short prayer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. Moments later, I return to the fray, swinging my weapon at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109460;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy on you, because I won't!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109461;One of my guards and trusted companions is struck down in the midst of battle. We manage to pull him to the side, but it is too late. As life begins to fade away from his eyes, I mutter some prayers to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for his sake...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109461;My dear friend! But soon I must return to the melee...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Jewish Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109462;Last night, I had a dream where Yahweh confronted me about some of my controversial decisions as a ruler. I argued back, citing Deuteronomy in my defense, and He was so pleased He conceded to my arguments.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109462;"My child defeated me!" He said with glee.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109463;Today an important Jewish scholar is visiting from afar, but instead of entertaining him, you watch exasperatedly as he gets into a theological argument with one of your courtiers. You decide to tell them...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109463;"Stop, with the arguing and the shouting and the debating!";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109463;Nothing. Why bother?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109463;That they're both wrong, joining in on the argument. “I cite Leviticus, that…”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109464;It appears like yesterday's meal did not meet Jewish dietary restrictions. Upon further investigation, you learn that one of your cooks, being a lazy sort, did not properly prepare the meal, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109464;Bring him to the religious authorities so his punishment can be determined.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109464;It was just one day without Kosher food, what's the big deal?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109465;One of your annoying courtiers has always been interested in Kabbalist views, and has recently been trying to convince others of the validity of reincarnation, or “Gilgul.” Everyone tries to ignore him, but the fellow keeps rambling on and on about it. Is he that obsessed with the idea? I have to talk him out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109465;Look, no true Jewish man believes in that, because...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109466;When I woke up this morning, I was so preoccupied with matters of state that I forgot to say the Shacharit, or morning prayer!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109466;I’ll try to remember tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Memories Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
1000109467_choice_a;What could you do? Your guardian was right - there was, and is, no way a noble and a peasant could marry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
1000109467_choice_b;It was painful telling your lover the news.;;;;;;;;;;;x
1000109467_choice_c;If only you weren’t distracted by other business that day, you could have saved your lover!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109467;It was sad knowing you would never see your first love again. Though young, this event taught you a very valuable lesson, that…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109467;Everyone has a place in society, including myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109467;Life is terrible, and no one is ever happy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109467;No matter what, I will see my love again in heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109467;True love is stupid idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109468;You got lost while hunting in your territory. As you find your way back, you by chance come to a small but hazardous river. You suddenly remember how you were once here, as a young man, hunting with your friends. One of them nearly died tripping on a slippery rock. At the time you thought it hilarious, seeing your friend slip like that. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109468;Now I see we were foolish to ignore the dangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_childhood_friend_merchant;The two of you engage in good conversation. It is always good to see an old friend!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109469;“You! I know you! We were still youths when we last met!” exclaims the merchant you accidentally bumped into. It takes a few seconds for you to recognize one of your childhood friends. It isn’t long before you two go to the tavern to catch up. As you two reminiscence about your younger days...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109469;You ask him about that girl he once loved.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109469;You talk about when the two of you were apprentice merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109469;You discuss the hardships of life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109469;You share your adventures as traders traveling the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000109470;Evening with an Old Friend;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109470;“Haha, I’m glad that ended well, though,” your friend says. You learn that while he is not too wealthy, he has engaged in some rather cunning and profitable schemes as a traveling merchant. For instance, there was one time he and one of his associates managed to purposely crash the market price of pyrite in one city as part of their business scheme.\nCertainly, he has learned  a lot traveling around. After a while, you ask him, “Why don’t you work for my family’s business? I know you’re capable, and we can provide you the financial protection and assets you need.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109470;“I need to think about it, but it’s a hard offer to refuse!” he replies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000109471;Evening with an Old Friend;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109471;“Haha, too bad it didn’t end as well as I hoped,” your friend says. The two of you continue chatting for some time, but eventually you part ways, for tomorrow your friend will travel to a far-away city to engage in some venture. Before leaving, however, your friend offers you some useful advice on the constantly changing prices of various goods your family tends to trade in. “In the Far East, the price for several commodities are dropping really fast, and I think it will affect several key markets,” he tells you, before explaining why. As you listen intently, he continues, “In order to profit from that, I suggest that you…”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109471;I did not expect that! I must act fast to profit from this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109472;Your workload has been very light recently, and you’ve taken the opportunity to spend more time with your lover. Tonight, the two of you are playing around on your bed, when your lover suddenly remarks, rather alluringly, “Remember the first time we made love on this bed? That was so wonderful, when you...”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109472;Who says we can’t relive that experience, right now?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109473;It is difficult being so elderly in a time when it is considered lucky to live to even half my age. I recall when everyone of my generation began to die, years ago. At first I was afraid I would be next, but I was lucky. I lived, while my friends and family keep dying one by one. Such “luck,” however, has only left me lonely and depressed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109473;Someday, I will join the rest in heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109473;Still, I try to enjoy life while I still can!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109473;Now, I no longer fear death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109474;The distant memory of kissing your first love for the first time has been haunting you these past few days. Unfortunately, your love was a mere commoner, a peasant’s child who used to live near your castle when you were younger. Eventually, as you recall sadly, you two had to part, when…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109474;Your guardian discovered the affair.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109474;You had to separate, out of a sense of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109474;Your love died in an unfortunate accident.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Shady Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109475;Your guards report that a strange, dark-skinned man, claiming to be a representative of an Abyssinian prince, is standing outside your residence. He wants to meet with you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109475;How odd… let’s see what the fellow wants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109476;You meet with this strange, dark-skinned man, and begin a conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000109476;We Just Need Your Money...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109476;To your surprise, the dark-skinned man is polite and cordial as he makes you an offer. “I am a merchant in service to Mwizi, the good Christian Prince of Abyssinia. My former lord - a most pious and virtuous Christian, I assure you - recently lost his realm in a disastrous war against the barbarian Muslims, and we hid his large treasury on the island of Ndoto. Unfortunately, he lost all his men in the war, which is why he sent me to you. If you are willing to give me some of your gold to pay for the men and ships who will retrieve these riches, we are willing to give you a quarter of it, which would amount to at least 1000 gold! Your aid to a fellow Christian ruler would be most appreciated by Christians around the world.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109476;Hahaha… a fine story. Now get lost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109476;Mwizi and Ndoto don’t sound like Abyssinian words, liar...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109476;I must help this Christian Prince! Give this man some gold!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109477;You meet with this strange, dark-skinned man, and begin a conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000109477;We Just Need Your Money...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109477;To your surprise, the dark-skinned man is polite and cordial as he makes you an offer. “I am a merchant in service to Mwizi, a good Prince of Abyssinia. My former lord - a just and courageous man, I assure you - recently lost his realm in a disastrous war against barbarian Frankish Crusaders, and we hid his large treasury on the island of Ndoto. Unfortunately, he lost all his men in the war, which is why he sent me to you. If you are willing to give me some of your gold to pay for the men and ships who will retrieve these riches, we are willing to give you a quarter of it, which would amount to at least 1000 gold! Your aid to a fellow ruler would be most appreciated, a show of your generosity and kindness!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109477;Hahaha… a fine story. Now get lost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109477;Mwizi and Ndoto don’t sound like Abyssinian words, liar...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109477;I must help this Prince! Give this man some gold!;;;;;;;;;;;x
le_nigerian_scam;You give the dark-skinned man a hefty amount of gold. “Thank you very much!” the man tells you. “My lord, the Prince of Abyssinia, will be most pleased!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109478;It’s been a long while but the servant of Mwizi, Prince of Abyssinia, has not returned. Did I give all my gold for nothing? People keep saying I got scammed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109478;Someday Mwizi will give me my rightful share!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109479;Your courtiers keep saying you got scammed by the “servant” of Mwizi, “Prince” of Abyssinia. One day, however, he returns with a large chest of gold. “Thank you for helping us in our time of need,” the man tells you. “Mwizi is most happy, and has taken refuge in Hindustan, but wishes to give you your fair share.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109479;Ha! I knew it! My trust was well placed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109480;Oh! [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy, I should’ve never ate that! It was definitely a bad idea buying that cheap baklava from the baklava merchant. It seems like it was really old and spoiled - no wonder he sold it at such a low price. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109480;I’m starting to feel really sick…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109481;One of my close servants seems rather sullen lately, so I asked him if anything was wrong. He told me he recently was sent by my cook to buy a pig. He bought what he thought was a healthy piglet in a bag for a really low price. However, it turned out the bag contained not a piglet, but a cat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109481;Haha, that scam! Everyone knows about that one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109481;Tell me who did it. I’ll find him and punish him!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109481;I got deceived by that con several times, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109482;I’ve received damning evidence revealing that one of my servants is one of the more well-to-do smugglers in the region. No wonder he always seems so happy and well-to-do compared to the others!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109482;What he does is none of my concern.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109482;Expel him from my castle, but do no more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109482;Imprison him! He may have useful information.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109483;“A true relic of the city’s patron saint! See for yourself!” The merchant smiles through his crooked teeth as he shows me the bone. As I observe the bone, its ridges and its texture, the merchant continues, “This belonged to our saint, certainly, and I will give it to you for an affordable price.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109483;I’ll buy it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109483;No… I have a bad feeling about this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109483;That’s obviously a pig’s bone. What a fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109484;This will impress quite a lot of people. A holy relic!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109484;I happily show everyone the relic I bought for cheap, but one of my learned and more intelligent courtiers laughs as he proves that it is merely a pig’s bone. I was deceived!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109484;Throw away that useless thing, I have no need for it now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH COMETS Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109485;Peasants are always superstitious, and the appearance of a comet in the sky has caused panic among your people. They are convinced that this is a sign that the end of times is near or that something bad is going to happen in the near future due to your "inept" rule.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109485;It's an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109485;Stop looking at the sky!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109486;There hasn't been a comet or any such similar omen in such a long time, people are beginning to wonder whether this is a good sign from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109486;It's a sign!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109486;Stop looking at the sky!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109487;A comet has recently been sighted, but the astrologers say that due to various factors it is actually a good omen for once!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109487;I'm not complaining.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109487;Stop looking at the sky!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109488;Tonight I and a few courtiers are stargazing. Suddenly, one exclaims, “I think I saw a comet in the sky! That’s bad news!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109488;For the love of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], will you people just stop with the comets?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109488;Heavens have mercy! I think I see it too! We’re doomed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109489;I asked my nanny why everyone is running around in a frenzy. “A comet in the sky!” she exclaims. “Look! There! It’s an omen from the heavens, surely meaning the end of days! We’re all going to die!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109489;AAAAAHHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109489;Those stupid adults are scared by a big light in the sky?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109489;That’s the most boring thing I’ve ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109489;Stop looking at the sky and get back to work!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109490;Whenever people see a comet they go into a frenzy and think the end of the world is nigh - and they say I am the one who’s insane? Well, I’ve had enough of this nonsense. I’ll directly communicate with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and give the heavens a piece of my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109490;Hey, old friend, we need to talk…;;;;;;;;;;;x
asking_god_to_stop_comets;My friends keep telling me I’m cuckoo for comets.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109491;My attempts to contact the heavens was unsuccessful at first, but eventually I managed to talk a bit with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], who said that following my reasonable complaints the amount of comets in the sky will be reduced significantly for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109491;Thank goodness! Now everybody can stop looking at the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109492;My attempts to contact the heavens was unsuccessful at first, but eventually I managed to talk a bit with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], who said that my complaints were so annoying that the amount of comets in the sky will be increased significantly for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109492;Curses! I should have... By the heavens, did I just see a comet?;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Buddhist Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109493;Like many men, I enjoy a good hunt. Yet I’ve come to realize how the hunting of animals for sport clashes with the teachings of the Buddha, who taught that one should not take life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109493;It’s just an ideal. Death is the natural way of life!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109493;That’s right… I don’t feel so eager about hunting anymore…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109494;I have heard reports of a wise and great teacher, knowledgeable in the Dharma, who lives in the wilderness not too far from my residence. Seeking to learn from him, I sent an envoy to this master, requesting that he come to my court. Upon returning, my envoy told me that this great master was not interested in coming.;;;;;;;;;;;x
where_did_he_go;As a result the teacher mysteriously vanishes without a trace...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109494;Tell him if he doesn’t come, I’ll bring my warriors to punish him!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109494;Very well. I’ll respect his decision, and won’t bother him anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109495;Although I’m currently not on a meditation retreat, I think it’s important I continue my spiritual practice, so I’ve decided to take the day off to meditate and practice calming my mind. I tell my servants not to disturb me, lock my doors, sit down by my small bedside altar, and close my eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109495;Let’s begin...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109496;The death of one of my bodyguards deeply disturbed me. This man was a trusted friend and confidante! “I’d do anything to get him back,” I told one of the monks at the funeral. The holy man replied, “All beings must die. You will die, I will die - everyone will die. If you don’t understand this, you will continue to suffer.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109496;But… how can I live without my friend?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109496;That’s true. I can’t be too attached to the memory of my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109497;You are lucky to have a renowned but usually reclusive monk and meditation master visit today. You ask him, “How much merit have I earned for supporting the Buddhist faith in this country?” He replies, “None,” before unceremoniously leaving.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109497;What a charlatan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109497;I think I just gained a bit of insight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109498;A monk accompanies me today as I am traveling to one of my realm’s fortresses. As we stop by a small river to gather water, I notice a scorpion drowning in the water. The monk picks it up and is stung before he sets it aside on the ground. “Why do you save it,” I ask, “If you know it is in the scorpion’s nature to sting?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109498;“Because,” the monk replies, “It is my nature to save.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109499;My servants report that several monks are outside my residence begging for alms. They seem to be very persistent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109499;Away, vile beggars!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109499;Give them some of our leftovers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109499;Give them some good, freshly made food.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109500;Your devout wife insists on lighting incense everywhere in my residence in order to encourage a spiritual atmosphere. Her devotion to the Dharma is admirable, but the ever-present, suffocating smoke is annoying a lot of people and making their lives miserable - you included.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109500;Tell her to stop lighting incense.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109500;Tell she is causing others to suffer, which goes against Buddhist doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109500;What she does is none of my concern.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Childhood Ambition Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109501;Today an important foreign dignitary visited the court. Though it wasn’t easy, I managed to impress this dignitary with my ability in conversation. My guardian has taught me quite a lot about talking with others!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109501;I was pretty nervous though.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109502;Today an important foreign dignitary visited the court. How impressed I was when my ward managed to engage in a sophisticated discussion with this dignitary. My ward has learned quite a bit about the art of conversation from me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109502;I am very proud.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109503;Recently, my guardian takes me with [Root.Guardian.GetHerHim] whenever we travel around the country. I hear boring lectures about what people trade, the crops the peasants grow, what happens inside cities and ports…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109503;My guardian says this will be important to me later on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109504;Recently, I’ve taken my ward with me when I traveled around the country, visiting different villages, castles, and cities. I constantly explain to my ward how people trade, what sort of crops we grow on the land, and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109504;It’s important my ward learns these things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109505;Adults can be so cruel and petty, always scheming against each other for one reason or another! That’s why my guardian takes time to explain to me what exactly they’re up to, so I won’t grow up to be naive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109505;I’ve learned a lot about intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109506;My ward isn’t usually involved in court intrigue, so I fear that the child might grow to be too naive. Thus, whenever some of the other courtiers engage in suspicious activities or gossip, I always make sure to explain their true intentions and schemes to my ward.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109506;I do so away from the others, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109507;My guardian is very demanding. [Root.Guardian.GetSheHe] always wants me to read these books or scrolls about boring stuff like “natural philosphy” even though I want to do other things like play with my friends. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109507;Though I will admit some of it is really interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109508;I think it’s important that my ward gain a better understanding of the arts and sciences. A well-rounded person will always do better, after all, so the child is made to read texts on subjects ranging from natural philosophy to history and theology.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109508;Not that I expect the child to understand it all…;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Bad Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109509;A month ago you bought some baklava from a traveling baklava merchant. Today you wished to share some of it with a visiting dignitary, but to your horror you realize the baklava has spoiled. Unfortunately, it’s too late - the dignitary eats a few of the delicacies and begins puking for a while afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109509;I’m so sorry! I’ll buy fresher baklava next time!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109510;A while back I sentenced a commoner to death for a heinous crime. Today, I’ve just learned he was actually framed by a rival. Though I have arrested and ordered the execution of this rival, the wrongful execution of an innocent man is a stain on my honor and ability as a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109510;Not good news at all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109511;In the middle of a meeting with your courtiers, you accidentally bite your tongue as you try to speak. In the midst of your pain, you shout some curses and other nasty words. Though you eventually calm down, everyone is surprised at your sudden outburst - surely, you normally don’t talk like a sailor, do you?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109511;Whoops.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109512;I’ve received news that one of my associates has been convicted of fraud, among other things. This is surely a stain on my reputation as a businessman!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109512;I have to minimize the damage as much as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109513;It is time for breakfast. When you make your way to the main eating hall where your courtiers are assembled, you notice they are looking at you strangely. Then, you suddenly realize that you did not properly put on your clothes, and parts of your lower body are showing. How embarrassing!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109513;Better run back to my room and readjust that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Bug Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109514;My nanny says I shouldn’t eat worms, even though they’re so tasty!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109514;My stomach hurts...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109515;The crickets are chirping and singing quite loudly tonight, more so than usual. This is a rather odd occurrence… maybe it’s a bad omen, like another comet? Or perhaps it is a good one?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109515;Their music is beautiful - this is a good thing!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109515;I can’t go to sleep - this is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109516;It was supposed to be a peaceful, quick walk in your garden. Then you got stung by a group of angry bees.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109516;Ouch! I shouldn’t have walked in that direction!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109516;I have to get a few herbs to soothe the wound.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109517;I just saw a lot of ladybugs outside in my private gardens, more so than usual! A good thing, as the old [Root.Culture.GetName] elders say, for ladybugs are bringers of good luck and indicate one’s wishes will soon be fulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109517;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109518;You’ve lived in Egypt long enough to notice that many of the ancient, pagan monuments often have depictions of beetles, be it as statues or wall paintings. The locals say the pagans worshipped dung beetles.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109518;Disgusting! The pagans are truly barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109519;One of my courtiers has a strange habit of squishing bugs whenever there are any nearby. “It’s a lot of fun, killing these wretched things, seeing them scurry around in fear!” my courtier says.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109519;We should love God’s creation, not destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109519;We should respect these industrious beings, not destroy them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109519;You are very childish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109519;Fun? I want to join in on the fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
