VIETmisc.2016.desc;A new cosmetic popular among the noblewomen is made using the egg yolk of from quail eggs instead of the usual chicken eggs. But quail eggs are a rare luxury much more suited for gourmet food. Are these women truly vain?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.a;A useless product!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.b;I could've eaten those eggs... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.c;This does not concern me. The fad will pass in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.d;I think it looks nice on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2017.desc;Yesterday was a local traditional festival held annually in the city. During the night, while I was away celebrating, some drunk and inconsiderate revelers dared to egg the front of my house! Now I have to pay to clean it up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2017.a;Maybe those hooligans were sent by my business rivals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2018.desc;Yesterday I went to the local tavern and had too much beer. While drunk I ordered a large amount of pickled eggs to eat with my beer, as I usually do. However, this time, in my drunkeness I must have taken and paid for all the pickled eggs the tavern had. Now do I not only have to deal with my hangover, I have to figure out what to do with these eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2018.a;Looks like we'll be eating pickled eggs for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.desc;Today you visited one of your vassals. While there, both of you dined on a delicious sponge cake... or, at least, it was delicious until both of you nearly choked on eggshells. Now my vassal is highly embarrassed by his cook's incompetency at cooking with eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.a;And he should be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.b;It's no matter, things happen all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.desc;For dinner tonight I'll be having deviled eggs. What should be stuffed in these eggs, I wonder? My cook will make them taste good regardless of what's inside them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.a;Vegetables. Who says abstaining from excess isn't delicious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.b;Meat. I want something to strengthen me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.c;Milk, cream, or cheese. It shall taste richer and fatten me well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.desc;The unbeliever is brought before you to be sentenced. He refuses to repent and change from his erroneous ways. Ha! It is amazing there are people who do not believe in the Dulcinian faith. He is corrupted - but can he still be purified and without being executed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.a;Death is the only way this wretch can be purified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.b;Spare him. Didn't Jesus teach us to be merciful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.c;The Catholics would hunt and kill us. Let us not be hypocrites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.desc;The Dulcinian faith teaches me that it is acceptable to plunder and kill "good" Christians who support a corrupt hierarchy of clergy or go against us, for we are pure in our belief. Can we truly be pure if we kill our enemies, even if they are corrupt?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.a;Of course! God's creation must be purified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.b;I am starting to have my doubts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.desc;This commoner has nerve! He says your vassal should give him and their other neighbors money. We are good Dulcinians, after all, he argues, who live in an equal society - why does this noble then hoard money and luxuries and refuse to share it with others? However, your vassal refuses to give anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.a;Be a good Dulcnian my vassal, share the wealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.b;Ideals are good, but in the real world we can't always abide by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.desc;Do you remember that worthless knight, the one who was found guilty of irredeemably corrupt according to Dulcinian doctrine? He was just purified yesterday - that is, his soul redeemed (that is, he was executed most effectively). Now you have all his precious belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.a;Stuff for free! Ah, it's great when people are... "purified".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.b;Let's share the knight's things with the needy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.desc;Peasants in one of your provinces accused a minor noble of being corrupt, betraying the Dulcinian doctrine of equality and charity. Wishing to "purify" him, they lynched him, torched his house, and killed his entire family, including his innocent young newborn child!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.a;These damn peasants! They take our faith too seriously!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.b;If a baby were corrupted, I'd "purify" that worthless piece of trash too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2500.desc;Being a [Root.GetTitle] is dangerous as I have many enemies who want to kill me. Sometimes this makes me worry a lot. Today I even admitted to my beloved [Lover.GetName] that sometimes I fear [Lover.GetSheHe] is plotting my murder. Upon hearing this, [Lover.GetSheHe] responded, "Of course I want to be the one to kill you. If I kill you, I'll be the one closest to your deathbed.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.a;You're so sweet and romantic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.b;I don't want that kind of twisted love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.c;Ha ha, you always cheer me up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.d;You really are trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.desc;One of your courtiers is ridiculously lazy despite having the sort of talent men would envy. I keep trying to push this courtier to do something, to contribute to the world, to no avail. When I asked the reason for all this laziness, I got this reply: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick. Look, I'm not lazy. I'm just conserving my energy.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.a;Conserving energy to do what? Sleep all day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.b;Heh. I like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.desc;I have in my court a brilliant woman. Yet, when she is asked why and how she knows everything (so it seems), she always meekly replies, "I don't know everything. I just know what I know.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.a;Bah, she's trying to pretend she's so "humble.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.b;I respect such an attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.c;She accepts her position as a member of the docile gender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.desc;People say I am mad? Ha! I am the most powerful ruler alive. I am the great [Root.GetTitle], who can command the greatest armies on earth, who can make love to any and all living things! Today, I will do something satisfying, something worthy of my greatness. Why, I'll eat something... I'll take something stupendous and eat it. Yes, that's it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.a;I'll take my sister... AND EAT HER.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.b;I'll take this Incan potato... AND EAT IT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.c;I'll take this baklava... AND EAT IT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.d;I'll take some hummus... AND EAT IT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.e;I'll take those who oppress Jewish subjects... AND EAT THEM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.f;I'll take the ugliness of the Italians and Greeks... AND EAT IT AWAY.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2503.i;I'll take [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]... AND EAT THEM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.j;I'll take my enemies... AND EAT THEM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_a;Maybe I can brush her teeth too... [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows what I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_b;I love these occidental vegetables, especially when they're cut thinly and fried!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_c;Anyone who doesn't like baklava... WILL DIE! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_d;First though I need to find some falafel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_e;I will protect my Jewish subjects, for I love their music! It speaks to the soul...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_f;People question why I think all Italians are ugly? It's they who are mad, not me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_g;That should make the peasants shut up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_h;Nobody steals my sweetrolls! NOBODYYYYYYYY!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_i;And consequently become divine! Immortal! Invincible! BWAHOHOHOHOHOHO...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_j;It is better to be feared than loved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.desc;Your face is buried in your hands as you sit on your chair. You feel like you almost want to cry, or scream, or something. Life, it is so difficult! Your plans, always gone astray. Your hopes, always dashed. Your dreams, always destroyed. I'm in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.a;Having no sister to "comfort me" has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.b;My realm's troubles has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.c;The lack of male heirs has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2505.desc;"Nice boat," my lover comments, as we are inspecting one of my family's ships leaving port on a business trip.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2505.a;Why, thank you, that's so kind of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2505.b;Are you... YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2506.desc;I am sitting there quietly, eating my meal when someone joins me. Someone who is, to be specific, either unhinged or simply annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2506.a;"Hello there, my courtier," I say, trying to be polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2507.tooltip;Oh heaven save me, they have that atrociously stupid and hideous smile on their face again...;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2508.a;Yes, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2508.b;What do you want, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2508.c;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2508.d;Stop it, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2508.e;STOP IT, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2508.f;I'll punch you in the face, you buffoon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_no_angry;I will stay calm. I will stay calm. I will stay calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_yes_angry;I WILL STAY CALM. I WILL STAY CALM. I WLSTAY CALM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2509.desc;A moment later, thanks to your well-timed punch, [From.GetFirstName] lies on the floor, half-conscious, muttering something about yellow flying cats.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2509.a;Goodness gracious, I'm glad I don't have to deal with that madman everyday...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2510.desc;It is early in the morning, and I am awoken to a loud sound. I look upwards, and gaze at my bedroom door. There stands my daughter, holding a glistening, shiny knife, with the most horrific smile on her face. She says cheerfully, "You woke up yourself. That's too bad.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2510.a;What are you doing... with that knife -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.desc;"I was checking to see if you were awake yet," my daughter says just as I am about to make a run for it. "I'm helping the cook make some meat for breakfast, daddy, and we wanted to surprise you! Oh well. What meat would you like to eat later?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.a;IN THE NAME OF [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.b;Oh! Hmm... I'll take chicken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.c;You will not be cooking. It is improper for someone of your status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.d;Cook whatever, I don't care, let me go back to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.desc;We are all good Dulcinians, engaging in prayer to assure God of our purify and faith, when my courtier bursts in, saying, "Penitenziagite! Watch out for the draco who cometh in futurum to gnaw your anima! La morte e supremos. You contemplatum the apocalypsum. La-bas, nous avons il diabolo, ugly comme Salvatore;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.a;Never have truer words been spoken! Repent, brothers and sisters, repent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.b;Do not interrupt us. Unless you want to be... purified?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.c;You really are as ugly as you claim to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Cretan Fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.desc;Peasants nearby discovered a buried bull-shaped vase in the Cretan countryside. It doesn't appear to be of any contemporary style, and perhaps dates to ancient times. Discussing the matter with some local scholars, it seems that the Cretan pagans worshipped bulls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.a;It would make a nice decoration in my bedroom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.b;Perhaps I could sell it, given it is in good condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.c;Discard this pagan, heathen contraption! It is evil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.d;I notice many bull-shaped objects lying around Crete... I should study them more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.desc;As you sip on your Cretan wine and take a bite into the delicious Kalitsounia pie with herbs and sweet cheese, the musician approaches, holding the traditional Cretan lyra in his hands. "O [Root.GetTitledFirstName], for my next improvisation, shall I sing of love, or shall I sing of death?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.a;Sing of love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.b;Sing of death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.c;These Cretan cheese pies are DELICIOUS - wait, you said something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.desc;Another vendetta has broken out among two prominent Cretan families under your rule. These families aren't too powerful, relatively speaking, but they are powerful and influential enough that their activities are causing a lot of havoc in the area. This isn’t the first time you’ve heard of problems like this on Crete...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.a;Gah! These simpleton villagers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.b;Put an end to this feud. Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.desc;On the mountainsides and gorges of Crete are plenty of plants called "Cretan Dittanies." I've been told by many Cretans that there is no better way to prove one's love than traversing the difficult terrain to collect these plants when they bloom with lovely pink flowers - not to mention there are rumors they are an excellent aphrodisiac!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.a;Why would I risk my life for these stupid plants?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.b;I'll get some for my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.c;I'll get some for my spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9000.desc;Crete has produced quality wines since time immemorial, and it is an important part of local culture and tradition - festivals are constantly held throughout the year in different parts of the island to celebrate grapes and good drink. This year, you’ve found some time to attend one of these festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9000.a;Fun awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.tooltip;You prepare to attend one of the local Cretan wine festivals and set off for the village where a festival will soon be held.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.title;The Wines of Crete;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.desc;The wine festival is just as exciting as you expected. As you arrive at the village, you see hundreds of people - commoner and noble alike - gather to take part. There’s much to do, be it drinking delicious wines, participating in the many traditional Cretan dances, or enjoying the good food! You can’t believe you don’t come to these celebrations more often.\n\nFriends, guests, even passersby lifting their glasses to toast, and wishing well to each other. Instruments start play. Hearts warm up. Arms open. Spirits are high! Big Cretan men lead the dance, while women and men alike sing traditional songs. People exchange smiles, banters, good feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.a;This is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cretan_festival_next;The festival is well under way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.tooltip;Drinking wine is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.desc;No wonder Crete is famous for its wines! They are many and of great quality. You’re sampling the various different wines available, including the notoriously strong “raki” or “tsikoudia.” As you continue sipping on the fine wine, a few of the local men - burly, big fellows with the infamous Cretan mustaches - invite you to join them in the drinking contests!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.a;No thanks, I've drunk enough for now. Maybe later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.b;Haha! I’ll beat these amateurs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.tooltip;I have to remember when I can and can’t dance, though, the Cretan locals can be quite fussy about the rules of dancing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.desc;Cretans sure love to dance! The locals have so many dances, it’s hard to keep track of which is which - trizalis, tsiniaris, kanelia, ntames, pidikhtos, and the energetic war dance, the pentozali, which is full of high jumping. Men and women alike are running and jumping and twirling and twisting with unrestrained liveliness.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.a;Maybe I should join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.tooltip;So much good food, so much good food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.desc;There is so many types of Cretan food. Simple peasant meals, perhaps, but they’re delicious! Kalitsounia sweet cheese pies, traditional Dacos bread, Cretan sausages and cheeses, pomegranates, chestnuts…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.a;One would think I’m at a food festival, not a wine festival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9005.desc;Unfortunately, all good things have to come to an end. The wine festival concludes, and you must return home. It will be a while before you’ll find time in your schedule to visit one of these local celebrations, but perhaps it wouldn’t be a bad idea to come back in the future. After all, it’s rare for you to experience that much excitement and merriment in such a sort time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9005.a;Now back to my dull old life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9006.desc;As you ride upon your horse, into the horizon, you gaze one last time at the village you just visited for the wine festival. A few of the villagers are still milling about, perhaps with hangovers. Absentmindedly, you shout goodbye to the them. To your surprise, they cheerfully shout farewell back at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9006.a;Haha! I’ll miss you all! It was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.desc;Crete's prosperity is undeniable! Muslims from the Levant and North Africa keep coming in order to seek their fortune from Crete's commercial opportunities. Today, one such man came to my court, seeking to serve me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.a;Very well, we will allow him to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.b;He can find another patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2513.a;Wait! I'd like to hear him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2513.b;Another beggar? Do they grow on trees?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2514.name;Britannia Is In Peril!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2514.desc;The guards begin to drag him away until yo tell them to stop. After a minute, the old man finally catches his breath and falls to his knees before you.'Finally I have found the Avatar! The embodiment of the 7 virtues! The master of the codex of infinite wisdom! Savior of the world so many times! My Lord Avatar, the world of Britannia is in peril! You must come with me to save it or else all will be lost!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2514.b;Ooook, I've heard enough. Out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2515.desc;Without thinking twice you run outside with the old man to begin your quest. When you reach the courtyard he draws a piece of chalk and uses it to draw a game of hopscotch on the floor. 'Avatar! Before you lies a test of dexterity!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2515.a;I'm the Avatar and I'm not afraid of some hops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2515.b;A child's game? Goodbye old man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2516.desc;You navigate the test of dexterity with the ease of a 5 year old and the old man is radiant. 'Well done Avatar! To the woods now, where destiny awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2516.a;Destiny and the salvation of Britannia!;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2516.b;Going to the woods with your crazy self? Err... No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Suddenly the old man becomes alarmed and starts pacing back and forth as if looking for something on the ground or in the sky. You become alarmed that you may have been led to a trap as the man start muttering 'There was supposed to be a fortune teller... cards...skills... No! You are not the Avatar! I was wrong!' With this is runs away with unprecedented dexterity, leaving you to wonder what just happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2040.desc;Not again! While passing by some Chinese travelers at the local market today, I heard them commenting on the beauty of [Root.Culture.GetName] women. Why are these Chinese so obsessed with our women? Apparently they’ll call even the ugliest [Root.Culture.GetName] girl a “flower unlike any other”! Haha!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.a;The silly Chinese don’t know where to look for real [Root.Culture.GetName] beauties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2042.desc;The old murals that decorate your palace are beginning to deteriorate - they were painted centuries ago, after all. Now is a good time to renovate these murals, perhaps even re-do them with completely new murals. Typically, Sogdian murals tend to focus on either of three things: the divine, heroes, or fables. What shall the new murals focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.a;The divine - gods and spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.b;The heroes - brave men like Rostam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.c;The fables - lessons we all should remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.d;I don’t want to waste money on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2043.desc;While passing by one of the local Sogdian villages, you happen to encounter a woman and her infant child.

The sugar symbolizes the hope that when the child grows up that his words be sweet...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2043.a;We Sogdians shall forever be the best traders and diplomats in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2044.desc;Growing up as a Sogdian child has its disadvantages. Everybody expects you to do well in commerce one day. It’s as if all the adults can think about is money, ways to make money, ways to produce more money, money, money, money, money…;;;;;;;;;;;x
