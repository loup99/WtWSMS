#GREAT SACRIFICE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109018;The great sacrifice continues. As part of today’s ritual, you begin singing hymns to the deities, praying for blessings. As you do this, you bring offerings before the altar, specifically...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1000109020;Proceed with the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#BYZANTINE EMPIRE CLAIM;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109019;While the Empire has seen darker days, these are still troubling times indeed, and I feel [Liege.GetTitledFirstName] isn’t the best ruler for the Empire. In fact, I think I would make a much better ruler than [Liege.GetHerHim]. It’s time to get involved in the byzantine politics of the Empire and press my own claim on the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109019;Someday I will sit on the imperial throne!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109044;I have successfully seized the imperial throne for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109044;Let’s hope nobody tries to do the same to me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109044;It is but the will of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109045;With this latest victory you have distinguished yourself as a great leader of armies and none can deny your kingly material. As you and your soldiers celebrate your victory, you can't help but wonder whether you (or perhaps one of your descendants) shall sit upon the imperial throne one day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109045;If only there was an opening on the imperial chair...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109045;I am not interested in claiming the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#SVRVEY REALM DECISION;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
surveyed_realm_recently_text;Hasn't surveyed realm recently;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109048;Messengers come to you in the midst of your tour of the realm, warning you that alarming developments have transpired while you were away - you are now at war!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109048;We must hurry and finish this tour of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109049;It’s been many years since I’ve surveyed my realm. Undoubtedly things have changed since then, and some of my courtiers suggest this would be a good time to travel the land once more and see how my realm is doing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109049;I’ll think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109050;After deliberation with your advisors and family, you have decided to survey your realm. The preparations will take several days, but the experience will be worth it. After all, it is one thing to hear of how your realm is doing, but another to see it with your own eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109050;I cannot wait.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109050;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] makes preparations for the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109051;Readying your horses, carriages, and entourage, you leave your residence early in the morning. You will probably be gone for a month or so as you try to learn more about your realm. What do the nobles do when you’re not around? How are the commoners surviving? Which regions prosper, and which languish?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109051;So many things to find out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109052;You are about half-way through your survey of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109052;Onward! We still have more traveling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109053;Your survey of the realm is almost complete. There is only a little bit more traveling to do. It might be a good is time to reflect on everything that has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109053;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109054;Your survey of the realm is coming to a close, and you are almost home. The sight of your residence in the far distance is a welcoming sight, indeed. Nevertheless, you have learned much from your journey, and hopefully these lessons will serve you well in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109054;Still, there’s no place like home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109055;While traveling, you happening upon a strange merchant from the far east who calls himself “Qi Ma the Liar.” Insisting on speaking in the third person, he greets you while twirling his cat-like whiskers: “Qi Ma knows much, tells some. Qi Ma knows many things others do not.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109055;I’m bored. Let’s see what this eccentric fellow knows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109055;I shouldn’t associate myself with strange references.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109056;Qi Ma says, “So many crusader kings kill their firstborn sons. Some say because he is not as intelligent as the second son. Some say because he is not as strong as the third son. Some say the daughter will make a better heir. Qi Ma is glad his parents loved him no matter what.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109056;Um... I think my parents loved me too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109057;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma loves Europe and the Middle East. Many interesting events that happen to them. Much more than in Cathay.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109057;I sense deja vu.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109057;Wait, didn’t this already happen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109058;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma has heard that people of the mediterranean are too dark, people of Russia are too ugly, and people of Europe and Middle East all look the same and boring. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.” ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109058;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109058;No. Some are better than others!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109059;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma always sees Byzantine nobles playing tzykanion in their spare time. He thinks they have nothing better to do when they aren’t being killed by the Fatimids.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109059;Interesting observation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109059;We Byzantines just love our tzykanion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109059;That’s why the Byzantine Empire was overrun by its enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109060;Qi Ma says, “Some do not know, but the Catholic Church is open-minded on some things more than others. Qi Ma has heard that the Cardinals will elect a Muslim or a nomadic warrior as Pope if they accept a Latin name!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109060;Well, that’s ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109071;While traveling in the countryside, your entourage discovers a seemingly abandoned bandit camp. Curious, you explore the camp, only to be immediately ambushed by bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109071;Let’s fight these cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109071;Run away! Retreat!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109072;You and your entourage come across a horrific scene while patrolling some of the nearby roads: an entire caravan of merchants, massacred, possibly by bandits, business rivals, thieves, who knows what! Some of your men suggest you loot all their belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109072;Why not? They won’t need their belongings in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109072;No. We should give them a proper burial.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109061;A small band of robbers foolishly attacked me while I was surveying my realm! My bodyguards easily defeated them, and the survivors are now at my mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109061;Release and make them vow to find honest jobs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109061;Imprison them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109061;Execute them on the spot!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109062;I and my party come across the skeleton, half-buried in the mud, its hand still clinging onto a sword. This dead man must have bravely fought to the death before meeting an unfortunate end. Perhaps we should give him a proper burial?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109062;Let’s give him a proper burial, first.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109062;Pray for his soul and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109075;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bury the skeleton and then set up camp for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109075;Saddened that such a man did not receive a proper burial, you decide to properly bury the skeleton yourself. That night, the ghost of the fallen man comes to you in a dream. Thanking for your kindness, he tells you of a small treasure he buried, and its location.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109075;So... he said walk five hundred steps to the north...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109075;It would be dishonorable to steal such a treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109063;While surveying the realm, you stay at a small outpost one night. However, you can’t help notice how it is falling into disrepair. Discussing the matter with the outpost’s commander, you learn the outpost doesn’t have the funds for a renovation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109063;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109063;Give the outpost some funds from your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109063;Bring in expert builders and resources from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109064;You have come to one of the larger settlements in your realm. Tired from all your traveling, you decide to visit the city’s pleasure quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109064;To the whorehouse!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109064;I’ll just get a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109064;A walk and fresh air is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109064;I should go pray at the local church instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109064;I should go pray at the local mosque instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF1000109064;I should go pray at the local temple instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109065;Tonight I am staying in one of the fortresses of my realm. It is a mighty fortress, built with the sturdiest wood and toughest stone, yet to your horror you learn that the warriors guarding this fort are horridly incompetent and untrained - they can’t even hold their swords and spears the right way!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109065;Give funds to assist these soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109065;Bring soldiers and supplies from elsewhere to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109065;I should help train these fellows myself!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109066;Your journey through your realm continues. Up ahead, you spot a dirty, impoverished village. Although it is almost night time, and you must find a place to rest, a member of your entourage suggests you move on. “After all, we shouldn’t mingle with these disgusting peasants.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109066;Dirty or not, we’ll rest here tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109066;Let’s leave this stinkhole!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109067;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] rests in the village for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109067;Your stay at the impoverished village was worse than you imagined - all the mud, insects, manure, and unidentifiable substances! However, the villagers, honored by your presence, decide to present you with small gifts as you are about to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109067;Refuse it - they need it more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109067;Thank you very much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109067;I demand more!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109067;Let’s give them some of our belongings instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109068;Today I am visiting a holy site in my realm. I’ve just arrived, and someone should be showing me around this place anytime soon...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109068;Pray for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109068;Pray all day long.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109068;Offer donations.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109068;Let’s move on, who cares about this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109069;Today I am stopping by one of my vassal’s residences. However, the food prepared doesn’t taste that good, to be honest. I almost vomited, but managed to trick my host into thinking I was choking on something.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109069;Thank you for the great food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109069;This ‘food’ tastes worse than manure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109069;I’ll help them find better food supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109069;I don’t mind the taste. It’s just... different.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109080;While traveling in the forest, you come across a lost child. Crying, the little girl says she was playing with her friends in the forest when she got lost, and she hasn’t been home in several days. After giving her a bit of food, she tells you that she lives in a nearby settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109080;Leave her. She deserves it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109080;Let’s help the poor child find her way back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109081;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] entourage escort the little girl back to town.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109081;You escort the little girl back to a nearby city, and learn that her father is in fact one of the wealthiest merchants in the city. Crying tears of joy, the merchant tightly embraces his daughter, before offering you a great reward for finding his little girl.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109081;No need for the reward, I’m only doing my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109081;Why thank you, I am such a good person.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109081;Don’t worry about it, my children are crazy too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109082;While staying at one of the local holdings, I’ve met a talented guard captain. He is quite capable in military matters, despite having lowborn peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109082;Impressive. You set an example for us all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109082;Why don’t you come to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109083;While traveling, your entourage come across what first appears to be soldiers of your realm. After talking with them for a while, you realize they are bandits masquerading as your own soldiers! Where could they have stolen their disguises?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109083;Arrest them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109084;Today I am resting at one of my realm’s cities. Sitting near the window, I can hear the many conversations townspeople are having outside - the gossip, the rumors, the fears, the hopes, the anger, the happiness, the sadness... There are so many interesting things they say to each other!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109084;Did you know one of the guards used to be an adventurer...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109085;Today I am resting at one of my realm’s villages. Sitting near the window, I can hear the many conversations peasants are having outside. Frankly, though, it’s a little hard to understand the peasants, given they are uneducated and can’t express themselves well, but it’s educational nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109085;Someone saw a crab in the mud the other day, horrible creature.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109086;Today while my entourage and I stopped in one of my realm’s villages, one of the inhabitants ran up to me. He whispered to you how he needed your help, how everybody in the village was conspiring against him. “Come meet midnight behind that building there,” he says. “I’ll tell more. We must not be seen!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109086;Ignore the madman and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109086;Well, I don’t see what harm can come of this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109087;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] meets the town eccentric behind the large building at night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109087;As the day progressed, you asked the villagers about this madman. They say he’s just the town eccentric, a harmless fool. Nevertheless, when you meet him at midnight, he insists that the villagers are about to kill him. Taking out a large axe, he requests you give him permission to kill them all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109087;Guards! Arrest him! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109087;Ah, let him be, he looks harmless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109088;While on the road, you come across a traveling merchant who specializes in exotic sweets and delicacies from other lands. Currently he is selling off some of his baklava - syrupy pastries from the eastern Mediterranean - and offers you some at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109088;I’ll buy some. What is this baklava stuff, anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109088;I’ll buy some. Baklava is great!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109088;I’ll try one or two.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109088;No, I’m not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109089;Today I am traveling alongside some farmland. Suddenly, I come across one of the city boys harassing a pretty peasant girl. Apparently it seems like this fool is trying too hard to win the affections of this girl. Perhaps I should intervene in this amusing scene.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109089;You, boy, stop harassing that girl!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109089;You, boy - learn how to woo a lady properly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109089;They remind me of my younger self.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109089;Bring the pretty girl to my camp tonight whether she likes it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109090;As I travel on the road today, I’ve come across a wandering musician. He says he can play me a good song if I spare him a coin or two.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109090;Bah, who wants to hear your noise?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109090;Sure, sure - sing, my good man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109091;Listen to the musician sing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109091;The musician’s song is beautiful indeed, an epic, lyrical tale of heroes and villains, love and war, and too many other things to name. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109091;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109092;Having traveled for several days, you come across a large estate. Hundreds of peasants are out in the fields, working hard to ensure the crops are taken care of in a proper manner. It is quite a wonder to see where all your food comes from.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109092;This is the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] at work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109092;An amazing testament of the power of men.;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.1.desc;Qi Ma says, “Norse are so serious about beards. So many beards. Qi Ma thinks they wish they had glorious beards like the Byzantines.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.1.a;Who knows?;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.2.desc;Qi Ma says, “Some say the Mongols are invincible. Some say Qi Ma is a liar. Don’t you believe either of those things.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.2.a;Well…;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.3.desc;Qi Ma says, “Some people think there can only be one empire called the Roman Empire. Others say there should only be two or three empires. Yet others say empires can be anywhere. Qi Ma thinks this is silly. Everybody knows the only empire in the world is China!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.3.a;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.4.desc;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma has heard it is dangerous to be the brother of a Mohammedan Sultan because their subjects hate rulers who have too many brothers, nephews, cousins, or uncles!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.4.a;It is unusual indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.4.b;Hey, I like it that way!;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.5.desc;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma's father was also called Qi Ma. As was Qi Ma's father's father. At least, that's what his father said.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
qimatheliar.5.a;What about your father’s father’s father?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.1.desc;Today we just left a small and quaint town, and are now about to cross a small stream. I decide to rest for a bit near this stream, which locals say has healing properties. After drinking some water from it, I suddenly feel refreshed. It’s like as if I awoke from a wonderful nap!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.1.a;Amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.1.b;The water just happens to be very pure, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.1.c;The stream appears to originate from a mountainous region that...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.2.desc;While visiting one of the cities in your realm, you decide to go to a local tavern in cognito. You happen to hear one man criticizing your rule. His arguments and solutions are interesting, though. Even more impressively, he isn’t terrified at all when you reveal yourself and threaten him with punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.2.a;An interesting man! I should bring him to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.2.b;He shall be arrested and taken to the local prison.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.2.c;His ideas are good - I should recommend him to the mayor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.3.desc;In one of the towns you visit, people are complaining about the local tax collector. They say he extorts more taxes than you require, and even keeps a small amount for himself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.3.a;What a terrible person! We should imprison him at once.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.3.b;Why should I care? I’m still getting the taxes I want.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.4.desc;Today I visit one of my vassals, and we discuss various local issues affecting his domain, be it the ability of his levies, the amount of food his land can produce, the amount of trade that goes through, and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.4.a;Interesting. Can you tell me more about…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.5.desc;Your party comes across a traveling noble and his bodyguards. Oddly, the noble doesn’t seem to recognize you, perhaps because he appears to be a rather low-ranked one who has never met you. The road is small, and the fool insists that you move over to let him pass, saying, “Lesser men like you should defer to us!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.5.a;Very well, it’s no matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.5.b;“Lesser”? How dare you address your superiors like that!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.5.c;Imprison him for his insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.6.desc;I just met a local patrol, who had just taken care of some highwaymen that had been terrorizing the nearby roads for weeks. As they dispose of the corpses, I congratulate them for their good work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.6.a;It is nice to see that my realm’s soldiers are competent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.7.desc;Today I met one of the nobles of my realm, who was traveling on some personal business. As it so happened we decided to camp together for the night, as larger numbers would deter bandits. We discussed some of the happenings of the realm, as well as what we were doing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.7.a;Our conversation was very pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.8.desc;While traveling, I’ve been talking a lot with one of the lesser knights accompanying me. We don’t agree on everything, but I’ve found our conversations fruitful and delightful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.8.a;You should come to my court and stay with me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.8.b;I’ve learned a lot about how my realm’s soldiers are doing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.9.desc;We came across an old, abandoned mine today. Who knows how prosperous it was when it was still in operation centuries ago? Regardless, there wasn’t much to see, but I did find a few valuable stones lying around.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.9.a;I suppose these are worth a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.10.desc;Wishing to understand how the peasants are doing, I talk to some in one of my realm’s villages. Some are very scared, others polite and careful, yet others friendly and cordial (as if I were their friend!). One, however, told me of how his family recently suffered from a house fire and lost everything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.10.a;A sad tale. Hopefully you’ll survive!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.10.b;I can offer a bit of gold to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.desc;You and your fellow travelers happen to meet with a small caravan of merchants. As it so happens, you both are headed to the same city. The merchants, seeing that you and your men are well-armed, request that you escort them to their destination. “The men we hired to protect us stole some of our goods and ran off,” they explain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.a;Very well, we will protect you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.b;No, I don’t have time. You’ll slow us down.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.c;Help you? Why don’t we just take your goods instead!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.tooltip;Escort the merchants to the city nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.desc;As you approach the city gates, the lead merchant tells you, “Thank you so much for protecting us. We can take care of ourselves from here. We don’t have much, but we wish to offer a few of our valuable merchandise in return for your kindness.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.a;Please keep that, you’ll need it more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.b;Thanks! It has been a pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.desc;You happen to come to one of your realm’s villages. The villagers report that a number of troublesome bandits have been raiding their village for some time, but the local authorities haven’t bothered to send any men, being busy with other matters. They beg for you to assist them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.a;I will send for a few of my soldiers as soon as I come home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.b;Why should I care about you dirty commoners?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.c;I feel obligated to teach them how to defend themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.14.tooltip;You spend some time teaching the villagers basic fighting techniques and military discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.14.desc;Impressively, the newly raised militia learned a lot in a short time. Just as you finish a training session, the bandits come back and attack. Under your command the villagers defeat and kill many of them. You are very proud of the villagers - no longer will they live in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.14.a;Continue maintaining the militia, and you will do well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.15.desc;One of the young men who fought in the militia was impressed with your leadership ability, and while he isn’t of noble blood, wishes to serve under you. This man in particular was one of the more outstanding fighters during the battle against the bandits, slaying many.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.15.a;Your village needs you more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.15.b;Good. You will bring your village much honor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.desc;My men and I come across some bandits on the road, and handily defeat them. While inspecting their stolen goods, we find a young girl tied up. After freeing her, she says she is from a nearby town but was kidnapped - her family, though, was unable to pay the ransom. She begs for you to escort her to town.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.a;I see. Let’s escort her back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.b;Men, leave us two alone. I want to have my way with this pretty thing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.c;She’ll be a burden, so I wish her good luck finding your way back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.17.desc;As you prepare to have your way with the girl, against her wishes, one of your guards - who you know as a bold young man with a great sense of justice and virtue - pleads for you to stop and control yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.17.a;You’re right. I’m… ashamed. Let’s just escort her back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.17.b;How dare you question me? Begone and let me enjoy myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
