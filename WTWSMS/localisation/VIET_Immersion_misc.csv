To the south, the decadent Almoravids are collapsing, replaced by an even more zealous dynasty, the Almohads. Portugal has just officially won its independence. Meanwhile, Castille and Aragon continue to resist the Muslims, hoping that one day their dream of the reconquista will be accomplished. Who will succeed in this turbulent region - Almohad or Almoravid, Spanish or Portuguese, Christian or Muslim?; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_SCOURGE_OF_GOD_DESC;From the East they came, ruthless and without mercy: strange men, dressed in exotic armor and speaking in guttural tongues that none understood. Rumors carried across the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean have told of how Genghis Khan and his invincible Mongol hordes shattered the greatest empires of the known world, from Cathay to Persia. Though Genghis Khan is now dead, the sons and grandsons of Genghis intend to continue his conquests. They have their eyes upon Europe and the rest of the Middle East, and the entire world may be united under the banner of Genghis... if his descendants do not end up fighting among themselves, that is. Perhaps the end of days has finally come at last, a punishment for the sins of the wicked... or perhaps this is God’s greatest test yet for the faithful.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_OSMANS_DREAM_DESC;With the breakup of the Sultanate of the Rum and the decline of the Byzantine Empire, several warlords in Anatolia seek ame and glory in the ensuing power vacuum. Foremost among them is Osman, a pious and brave man. According to a dream he had many, many years ago, some say that great things will be in store for Osman and his dynasty, and that they might even conquer great Constantinople one day. But the journey to Constantinople won’t be easy, and the Byzantine Empire, which has resisted attack after attack for almost a thousand years, will not go down without a fight.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KHITAN_DESC;For more than two centuries, the Khitan were the rightful rulers of northern China, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects. However, overthrown by their Jurchen vassals in the early years of the 12th century, remnants of the once-great Khitan have fled to Central Asia, where they seek to re-create their imperial splendor. Having just defeated the once-mighty Kara-Khanids and the Seljuks, the Khitan now have a foothold in the region. Will they continue their conquests, spreading their Sinicized nomadic culture and their Buddhist faith, or will they settle down, content with re-creating their Chinese empire in Central Asia? All that is certain, however, is that the Khitan are not the first horde to appear suddenly from the far east, nor will they be the last.;For more than two centuries, the Khitan were the rightful rulers of northern China, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects.

BM_LION_KING_DESC;West Africa is flourishing, despite the fall of the Empire of Ghana a century or two ago. Now a great leader has arisen among the Manden peoples: Sundiata Keita, the lion of Songolon. The Griots have already said much about this great king - some even claim he is a descendant of Bilal, companion to Prophet Mohammed and the first to call Muslims to prayer. Will the Lion King and his descendants unite the savanna into a great empire, harness the potential of its abundant gold, and make it the envy of the world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_OLD_GODS_DESC;§Y'How the little piglets would grunt if they knew how the old boar suffered.'§! Those were the prophetic last words of the legendary viking §YRagnarr Loðbrok§! as he lay dying in the snake pit of Northumbrian king §YÆlla§!. In 867 the vengeful sons of Loðbrok and their 'Great Heathen Army' descended upon the petty kingdoms of Britain to make of §YÆlla§! a 'Blood Eagle'. Meanwhile, two other Norse lords - §YRurik§! and §YDyre§! - were carving out their own rival states among the Slavic and Finnish tribes of the East, laying down the foundations for what would one day become Russia. Meanwhile, to the east, the onslaught of Islam continues against the old faiths of the Silk Road - §YZoroastrian, Buddhism, Manichaeism, Hinduism§! - but the loyal followers of these remnants are stubbornly defiant in the face of near-certain doom. The Old Gods are still strong and their warriors mighty!;§YÔ combien les petits porcelets ronchonneraient s'ils savaient à quel point a souffert le vieux sanglier.§! Voilà qui furent les dernières paroles prophétiques du légendaire Viking §YRagnarr Loðbrok§! alors qu'il gisait à l'agonie dans la fosse aux serpents de §YÆlla§!, le roi northumbrien. En 867, les fils vindicatifs de Loðbrok et leur 'Grande Armée païenne' ont pénétré dans les petits royaumes de Bretagne et ont fait de §YÆlla§! un 'aigle de sang'. Au même moment, deux autres seigneurs nordiques, §YRurik§! et §YDyre§!, souillaient les terres de leurs rivaux parmi les tribus slaves et finnoises dans l'Est, posant les fondations de ce qui allait un jour devenir la Russie. Les Anciens Dieux sont toujours puissants, tout comme le sont leurs puissants guerriers !;§YWie die kleinen Ferkel grunzen würden, wenn sie wüssten, wie das alte Wildschwein litt.§! Dies waren die prophetischen letzten Worte des legendären Wikingers §YRagnarr Loðbrok§!, als er sterbend in der Schlangengrube des northumbrischen Königs §YÆlla§! lag. 867 fielen die rachedurstigen Söhne von Loðbrok mit ihrer 'Großen Ketzerischen Armee' in die erbärmlichen Königreiche Brittaniens ein, um §YÆlla§! zum 'Blutadler' zu machen. Zu gleicher Zeit erschufen zwei andere nordische Lords - §YRurik§! und §YDyre§! - ihre eigenen rivalisierenden Staaten unter den slawischen und finnischen Stämmen des Ostens und legten den Grundstein für das, was eines Tages Russland sein würde. Die Alten Götter sind noch immer mächtig und ihre Krieger sind stark!;;§YCómo gruñirían los cerditos si supieran cómo sufrió el viejo jabalí.§! Esas fueron las últimas palabras proféticas del legendario vikingo §YRagnarr Loðbrok§! mientras agonizaba en el nido de vívoras del rey de Northumbria §YÆlla§!. En el 867, los vengativos hijos de Loðbrok y su ‘Gran Ejército Pagano’ descendieron sobre los pequeños reinos de Bretaña para hacer de §YÆlla§! un ‘Águila de Sangre’. Mientras tanto, otros dos señores Nórdicos, §YRurik§! y §YDyre§!, fueron forjando sus propios estados rivales entre las tribus Eslavas y Finlandesas del Este, estableciendo las bases de lo que un día se convertiría en Rusia. ¡Los Antiguos Dioses aún son fuertes y sus guerreros poderosos!;;;;;;;;;x
