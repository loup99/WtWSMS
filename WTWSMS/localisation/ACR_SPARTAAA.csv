this_is_not_sparta_desc;This Spartan character is a "Trembler", a craven and a coward. This makes him an anathema to every righteous Spartan alive, and is one of the only ways to lose Spartan citizenship. Until they can man up, this character has been excluded from Spartan society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inferior_spartan_child;Challenged Child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inferior_spartan_child_desc;This Spartan infant was born with a phsyical or mental defect. Per Spartan custom, he or she is to be laid on a hill for dead to test his or her will to live.

lame_spartan_desc;By virtue of being born a Spartan and showing bravery in the will to live, this character has proven their worthiness to hold Spartan citizenship despite their inability to fight. They will instead provide auxillary tasks for the betterment of Spartan society, such as artistry, farming, teaching, and the like. As he or she does not have to focus on the rigors of Spartan training, he or she has directed his or her Spartan work ethic and drive elsewhere, to other skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
