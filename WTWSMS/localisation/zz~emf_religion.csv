#
adoptionist;Adoptionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adoptionist_DESC;Adoptionists reject the Holy Trinity, believing that Jesus Christ was adopted as God's son at his ascension, chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God. They do not revere the Holy Mary, and were declared a Christian heresy at the end of the 2nd Century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic_DESC;Sometimes referred to as 'Gregorian', this was one of the early Christian faiths founded in Armenia by the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus. It split from orthodox Christianity in the 6th century as a matter of Christology -- they are miaphysite, believing Christ to be of one incarnate nature, where both divine and human nature are united.\n§Y*§! Learned Apostolics may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian;Arian;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian_DESC;Arianism is a nontrinitarian belief that asserts that Jesus Christ is a Son of God, created by God the Father, distinct from the Father and therefore subordinate to the Father. It denies that Jesus is God the Son. The Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea of 325 AD deemed it to be a heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haruri;Haruri;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haruri_DESC;The Haruri are a sect from the period of the Four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, named for their first leader, Habib ibn-Yazid al-Haruri. The Haruri were originally one branch of the Khariji 'Rejectors' movement, so called because they rejected Ali's right to the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Isma'ili;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;The Isma'ilis believe that, when the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq died, his true successor was not Musa al-Kazim as the others believe, but in fact was the already dead Isma'il and his son Muhammad. The line of Isma'il has been in hiding for years, but now has emerged to reclaim the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya;Mahdite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya_DESC;The Mahdites believe that the messiah, or Mahdi, has already risen, and given his commandments that clarify the Qur'an such that no other interpretation is valid. They are led by their own Caliphate of successors to the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean;Mandaean;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaeism is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus of Nazareth. It is represented in-game as an early form of Manichaeism, and a potential heresy should it resurface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manichean_DESC;Manichaeism is a Gnostic religion founded by the prophet Mani, who was put to death by the Sassanid Shahanshah Bahram I in 277. His 'Religion of Light' incorporated elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Gnosticism. At one point, Manichaeism spread far and wide, and was the biggest competitor with Christianity for replacing classical Paganism until it began to fade in the 6th century. Features:\n§Y*§! The Manichaean Archegos exists in the Old Gods and Charlemagne bookmarks, and may be restored later\n§Y*§! Manichaeans have their own holy festival, the Bema Feast\n§Y*§! Manichaeans may elect to dedicate themselves to a Shekhinah upon adulthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maronite;Maronite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maronite_DESC;Beginning as a movement founded by the monk Maron in the fourth century, the Maronites are a Christian Church in full communion with the Holy See yet under the leadership of the Maronite Primate.\n§Y*§! Learned Maronites may subscribe to either the Antiochian or Alexandrite schools of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_DESC;The Messalians, or Euchites ('Those who Pray'), are a heretical Christian sect that originated in Mesopotamia, influenced by dualistic faiths like Zoroastrianism. Messalians believe that God can be perceived by the carnal senses, and that this perception is necessary to reach perfection. Each person is born with an inner demon, and only intense prayer can drive it out. They also believe that Lucifer is the elder son of God and a force for good, and that incest is sacred since it was practised by the children of Adam and Eve. They have no formal rites and no strict church hierarchy. Features:\n§Y*§! Messalians must pray to expel their personal demons\n§Y*§! Once the demons are driven out, they can achieve the status of Perfection\n§Y*§! Learned Messalians may subscribe to the Antiochian school of theology\n§Y*§! Messalians may choose a patron saint to worship\n§Y*§! Messalians can create their own Holy Order, the Army of Lucifer\n§Y*§! The Patriarch of Antioch will automatically become the new religion head;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite;Coptic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_DESC;Copts are miaphysite, stressing that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character. This stance split them off from the main branch of Christianity after the council of Chalcedon in 451. Though not viewed as outright heretics by Orthodox and Catholic Christians, it is a fine distinction. The nominal head of the Coptic Church is the Pope of Alexandria.\n§Y*§! Copts may opt to become Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers instead of monks and nuns\n§Y*§! Learned Copts may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is an early Christian heresy which states that Christ had but a single nature. This is the opposite of the Nestorian position where Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. The nominal head of the Monophysite Church is the Monophysite Pope of Alexandria.\n§Y*§! Monophysites may opt to become Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers instead of monks and nuns\n§Y*§! Learned Monophysites may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nabawiyya;Nabawite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nabawiyya_DESC;The Nabawites believe that the Qur'an was only the holy book for the Arabs, and that they have their own holy book and prophet, just as legitimate, sent by God for their people, modelled on Islam. They are led by a Malik, similar to the Muslim Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;Nestorianism is an early Christian branch which states that Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. This is the opposite of the Monophysite position where Christ has but a single nature. The nominal head of the Nestorian Church is the Patriarch of the East.\n§Y*§! Learned Nestorians may subscribe to the Antiochian school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obj_become_saint_desc;A true saint can only be created after one's death, but it is possible to embark upon that path while one is still alive. It is not an easy journey, requiring humility and a dedication to religious ideals, but success means that one will enjoy piety and recognition -- and perhaps a greater chance of beatification after one's passing. Failure, however, can mean a loss of piety and worse, and failure will be far more likely the more sinful traits one possesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obj_become_saint_title;Become a Saint;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paulician_DESC;Paulicianism is Christian Gnostic heresy influenced by Manichaeism, originating in Armenia, and known for its militarist attitude and emphasis on only accepting the New Testament as legitimate. Features:\n§Y*§! May declare Holy War or Crusade on anyone of a different religion, even other Christians\n§Y*§! May gain the Icon-Breaker trait after sieging a Christian temple\n§Y*§! May expend Piety to raise units of zealots during a war\n§Y*§! Learned Paulicians may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian;Qarmati;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;The Qarmatians are a extreme splinter sect of Isma'ili Islam, and believe that there are seven ages of man, each with a new religion and prophet, and the final age is approaching. They believe that the rest of the Isma'ilis have lost the faith, and that Muhammad son of Isma'il is still in hiding, waiting to return as the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian;Tondrakian;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian_DESC;Tondrakians are an anti-feudal, anti-church sect that originally flourished in Armenia between the 9th and 11th Century. They denied the immortality of the soul, the afterlife, and the rights of the church to rule over its fellow man. They supported property rights for peasants and equality between men and women.\n§Y*§! Learned Tondrakians may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waqifi;Waqifite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waqifi_DESC;The Waqifi believe that the Imamate has ended before the main branch of Shi'ism has accepted it. To the Waqifi, the final Imam is the Mahdi who will return at the end of days, and they wait faithfully for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi;Zaydi;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;The Zaydis are a Shi'a group that believe that the 'Alid Imams are not infallible, but are divinely inspired and have a responsibility to lead rebellion against corrupt authority. Nor is the Imamate hereditary. Any 'Alid who rises up in rebellion can become an Imam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist;Zurvanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist_DESC;Zurvanism is a branch of Zoroastrianism that believes in the existence of Zurvan, a genderless god of of infinite time (and space), for whom there is no distinction between good and evil. Zurvan is the parent of the two opposites representing the good god, Ahura Mazda, and the evil Angra Mainyu, unlike normal Zoroastrianism, where Ahura Mazda is the Supreme Being. Zurvanism is further divided by its three schools of thought: Aesthetic, Fatalistic and Materialistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
bureaucratic_infighting;Court Infighting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bureaucratic_infighting_desc;If a ruler's court grows out of his control, the results can be devastating. It's entirely possible for the empire to fly apart at the seams. Even if it doesn't, it will become increasingly difficult for the ruler to exert influence over members of his court -- or keep them within the empire after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0;Court in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0_option;Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0_desc;The court is currently out of control, with rulers all but ignoring the throne's authority as they vie with each other for greater power and influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1;Order Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1_option;Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1_desc;Order has been restored in the ruler's court, with authority from the crown once again being respected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_group;Faith Organization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_group_desc;In its inception, the Bogomilist faith was only loosely organized. It didn't believe in formal churches, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy -- indeed, the hierarchy and tyranny of the Orthodox Church is partly what prompted its creation. Its anarchical nature also makes the faithful difficult to control with the traditional feudal structure. It is possible, however, for a powerful Bogomilist ruler to slowly organize and reform the faith into something permanent and lasting...but it will not be easy, and the common folk are likely to resist any such attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_0;No Bogomilist Organization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_0_desc;The Bogomilist faith is a movement which exists independent of, and sometimes opposed to, the structure of a feudal state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_0_option;None;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_1;Bogmilism Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_1_desc;The Bogomilist faithful recognize that feudal rulers are on their side, and are willing to co-operate to a large extent. The missionary work of the Perfecti is supported by the state, but beyond that the faithful still resist any notion of formal organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_1_option;Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_2;Bogomilism Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_2_desc;The Bogomilist faith now has a standardized set of liturgy and texts, and the various members of the movement have agreed to work together -- and not oppose their feudal rulers. They still operate outside of formal temples, and they still operate seperately from the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_2_option;Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_3;Bogomilism Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_3_desc;The Bogomilist faith now operates out of temples, and are willing to work directly with feudal rulers in their councils. They have been entwined enough with the state that there is no lingering sense of opposition -- as far as many are concerned, the two are inseparable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_3_option;Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_4;Pemanently Established;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_4_desc;A formal head of the Bogomilist faith has been established, creating a true Church of Bogomilism. More than that, Bogomilism will be recognized as an independent faith by fellow Christians, looked upon more as a schism from Orthodoxy than a heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_4_option;Permanent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priesthood;Fraticelli Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priesthood_desc;While all priests are initially monastic in nature, just as within the Catholic Church, the Fraticelli belief is that it is imperative for priests to take a more active role in the spreading of the faith and the operation of government. Thus a Fraticelli ruler is able to determine whether those ideals will be enforced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_0;Monastic Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_0_option;Monastic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_0_desc;The priesthood spends its time in seclusion, dedicating themselves utterly to their faith and to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

frat_priest_1_option;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

frat_priest_2;Bureaucratic Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_2_option;Bureaucratic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_2_desc;The priesthood is called upon to serve at the pleasure of their lord, taking an active part in the administration of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_desc;This law determines who appoints priests - the head of the religion or the secular liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_0;Religious Head Investiture;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_0_option;Head;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_0_desc;Only the head of the religion may appoint priests within the Realm. This will give the Crown a §G50%§! Piety cost discount when requesting special actions like Divorce and Excommunication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_1_desc;Priests within the kingdom can be appointed by their secular lieges, and will be more loyal to their liege. The head of the religion will not be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maz_wealth_group;Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maz_wealth_group_desc;One of Mazdak's primary teachings was that the Zoroastrian priesthood oppressed its people, and hoarded its wealth. He believed that wealth should be shared, and espoused ideas of egalitarianism that were way ahead of his time. A ruler of proper faith should, by the Mazdaki faith, set aside a large share of its taxes for the people -- and force his vassals to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_0;No Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_0_desc;There is no system of wealth sharing, just as it has always been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mazdaki_wealth_2_desc;The Mazdaki nobility must put aside a portion of thier wealth and taxes in order to subsidize the poorest of the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_2_option;Basic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3;High Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3_desc;A large amount of the taxes and wealth possessed by the nobility must go towards the people -- the building of shelters for the poor, the standard granting of gifts for the ill-favored, and the construction of hospitals for the sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3_option;High;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_4;Maximum Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_4_desc;The portion of wealth and taxes which are set aside for the common people goes far beyond what even Mazdak would have thought possible. The people would be very happy under such a regime, feeling as if a large amount of the work they do for their rulers are returned to them in kind. The nobility, however, will be far less pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_4_option;Max;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waldensian_charity_law;Waldensian Charity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] greets you at the entrance to [Liege.GetHerHis] estate, and it seems the festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_243;The Bema Feast is over for now. Another celebration of Light to drive back the Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_246;It is customary to fast in religious reflection before the start of the Bema Feast. Will you take part in this tradition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_246;I will fast for a week;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_246;I will fast for the next three days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_246;Go without food? Perish the thought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_247;The Singing of Hymns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_247;The Bema Feast starts with the singing of various hymns that celebrate the return of spring, the life and death of the Prophet Mani, and the battles the Forces of Light have won over the Armies of Darkness. All those gathered raise their voices to the gods, a chorus of faith and beauty that touches the soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_247;This is my favorite part;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_250;The Feast of the Elect;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_250;Only the Elect -- those who are devoted to the Manichaean faith -- are invited to take part in a ritual meal, which both symbolizes the life of Mani and the theology of the Manicheans. To take part is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_250;Honor and Glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_251;The Presentation of the Arzhang;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_251;The Arzhang, or Picture Book, is a work painted by Mani himself, which depicts the Manichean theology in simple terms, so that even the uneducated can read and understand the faith. The book rests on the bema until the feast is over, after which a priest recites sermons from it and absolves the sins of those attending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_251;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_257;The Persian Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_257;It is said that the Abbasids would never have been able to seize the caliphate without the aid of the great Persian general, Abu Muslim, who in the end was rewarded for his service with death -- executed on the order of Caliph Al-Mansur. Resentment for this perceived betrayal has long simmered as resentment among the Persian people, resentment which has now broken out in open rebellion. A peasant leader by the name of Babak, aided by his capable wife Banu, an effective general and archer in her own right, has risen up to free his nation from the unjust rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...and has already attracted a massive following, enough to present a real threat to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_257;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_257;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_258;The Mazdaki Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_258;Although the Prophet Mazdak always railed against the corruption of the Zoroastrian Priesthood, and his followers have never had an official structure to speak of, now that the faith has risen to such prominence under [Root.GetTitledName] it seems the time has come to give it to them. With [new_mazdaki_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] chosen as the new [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of the [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], the Mazdaki faith has entered a new era, with a priesthood rivalling that of the Zoroastrians from which they once stemmed...and have, perhaps, now exceeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_258;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_259;The Mazdaki teach there are four Powers that bring Light into the World: Discernment, Understanding, Preservation, and Joy. Any adult member of the faith may embrace one of these Powers. in an attempt to achieve eventual perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Discernment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Understanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Preservation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Joy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_260;You have begun preparations for the Tawûsgeran festival, also known as the 'Circulation of the Peacock'. You send out messengers with invitations to your Yazidi vassals, expecting all to come and honor Melek Taus, greatest among the seven angels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_260;I've been looking forward to this;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_261;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\n\nThe time has come once again for us all to celebrate the Tawûsgeran, a time to honor Melek Taus - He who is most holy amongst the seven angels. The festival will take place in [From.Capital.GetName], and you are hereby formally invited to attend.\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_263;The Tawûsgeran festival is well under way when you finally arrive in [FromFrom.Capital.GetName]. Priests walk throughout the crowds, giving out vials of holy water to the faithful. You can hear the holy rites to the Seven being chanted at shrines everywhere you walk, though the name of Melek Taus is most prominent amongst them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_263;An excellent time, to be sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_264;Peasants are streaming into [Root.Capital.GetName] from all over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for the beginning of the Tawûsgeran festival, and already your vassals are arriving. The chanting of rites to Melek Taus can be heard from the many shrines at your window, and soon the true celebrations will begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_265;The Circulation of the Peacock;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_265;The Circulation of the Peacock is about to start! In accordance with tradition, priests and pious men carry the senjaq, statues of the Seven Archangels, in circles around the city as they distribute blessings. To carry one of the statues is an honor reserved for only those of great wisdom and piety, as well as an event requiring considerable strength and willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_265;I wish to carry one of the statues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_265;I am content to watch the proceedings;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_266;As you carry the senjaq around, you discover that it is rather heavier than you expected. The unaccustomed weight causes you to stumble, and the idol slips out of your hands and crashes down to the ground and is damaged. Everyone stares in horror as you quickly pick it back up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_266;Only a few people saw that...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_267;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, the weight and the heat begin to take their toll upon you. As if in a dream, you begin to hear the voices of the Seven Archangels talking, telling you secrets and mysteries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_267;They have visited me! I am blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_268;With each step of the Circulation, more and more of the truth of your faith is reveled to you. Of course this is the proper path. How could any man doubt such a truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_268;For the glory of Menek Taus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_269;Perhaps it is the power of faith that fills you, but what once seemed so heavy at the beginning now feels as light as feather. Why, you could carry this senjaq around all day if the priests would let you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_269;Strength comes from faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_270;Veneration of the Senjaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_270;After the senjaq have been paraded around the city, the populace of the city comes forward to present their sacrifices and tributes. You visit each senjaq in turn, praying for the wisdom of the Seven Archangels, venerating them with holy incense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_270;For Wisdom and Honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_271;Gifts From the Pious;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_271;The final stage of the Tawûsgeran festival is the collection of alms from the pious. Every man and woman is expected to give, a contribution to the greater faith and in support of those in need. While most give only a few coins, those who are able are expected to give much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_271;I am a pious [Root.GetManWoman];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_271;I will give what I must, no more;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_271;Ignore this nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_272;The final ceremony is a grand sermon of thanksgiving to God and his servants. It was a rousing sermon as always, and the crowd begins the feast with great abandon. Another glorious celebration of the Seven Archangels has been completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_272;Praise the Seven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_273;The Tawûsgeran is over for now, and already the many decorations are being taken down. Melek Taus has been properly honored, and the realm is looking forward to a bright future under His wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_273;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_277;Sadly, the death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means the Circulation of the Peacock must be canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_277;Such is how it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_278;A Koasasa is Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_278_taus;The concept of metempsychosis, or rebirth, is central to the Yazidi faith. Indeed, they believe it is possible for the Seven Archangels to be reborn among the faithful as 'koasasa'. Today it has been declared that [Root.GetTitledName] is none other than the koasasa of the Peacock Angel himself, Melek Taus. Yazidi throughout the land celebrate this discovery, and everywhere the young man travels he is given offerings by those overjoyed by the angel's return to the mortal world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_278;I will do my best to live up to this honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_278;A glorious day for us all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_279;The pilgrimage to Lalish, a site just outside of the bustling city of Mosul, is one of the most important journeys a Yazidi can undertake. There one attends the Feast of the Assembly, and returns filled with the spirit and strength of the Seven Archangels...or so the story goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_280;The day has come. Your belongings are packed, arrangements have been made for matters in [Root.Capital.GetName] to be attended to while you are away, and your departure has been kept quiet to prevent the unsavory from taking advantage of your solitary journey. Now you must begin your journey to Lalish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_281;Arrival at Lalish;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_281;You arrive in the bustling city of holy Mosul, and it is not long before you make your way to Lalish, a mountain valley village not far to the north. This sleepy place is where the Yazidi faith truly began, and as the Feast of the Assembly unfolds, prayers offered to the Seven Archangels up in the heavens, you marvel at the conical roofs of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir's tomb. The rest of your stay will be spent in Mosul, but you cannot help but feel overcome at having taken a path so many have walked before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_281;Now, what to do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_285;The Yazidi Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_285;There are many who claim the Yazidi to be devil-worshippers, due to their veneration of the Peacock Angel they call Melek Taus or Shaytan. This has led the Yazidi to be considered Muslim heretics for countless generations, even though their religion incorporates syncretic elements of not only the Muslim faith but also Gnosticism and Zoroastrianism. Now, with [Root.GetTitledName] having risen to such power, [Root.GetSheHe] has declared the Yazidi to be their own faith and no heresy -- and [Root.GetSheHe] has the prestige to be listened to. In the end, it may change nothing save to the Yazidi themselves, but even so it is a sign as to just how far they have come since the ancient days of worshipping at hidden temples in the Kurdish foothills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_285;Praise to Melek Taus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_285;They are still devil-worshippers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1800;A New Reign;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1800;You are now the Caliph and, according to the tradition set by the 'Abbasids, may take a regnal name by which you shall henceforth be known, a name representing the virtues you seek to engender during your rule.

EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1800;I shall keep my name;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1800;I will choose a new name;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1803;The [FromFrom.GetFullName] can only properly fall to one who is a close relative of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], though perhaps a sayyid of sufficient piety could claim the title has their own.

EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1803;I am indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1803;I do not need the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1900;Anarchy at [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1900;Dire events are underway in [Root.Capital.GetName], capital to the mighty [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]: [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], considered by many to be a weak caliph, has been turned into a veritable prisoner within his own palace. His advisors have taken control of the court, and already cracks have begun to appear in its authority over the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s vassals. Whether [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will be able to regain control or whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will crumble into anarchy is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1900;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1900;This travesty is an affront to Allah;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_1900;It couldn't happen to a nicer caliph;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1901;While [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has taken command of the Sunni caliphate, the court remains firmly in control. You will have to be strong if you are to overcome their rule and restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1901;They will not get away with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1902;Order Restored in [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1902;It has taken a bloody coup, with [imprisoned_regent.GetTitledName] being overthrown and imprisoned, but [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has restored order in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The Sunni caliphate once again has authority respected by its vassals. It remains to be seen whether [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will exact more vengeance upon those of his court who kept him hostage, and whether he will be able to bring the lands he lost back under his fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1902;Ha! Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1902;This is a good thing, I think;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1904;The court of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] runs rampant with anarchy and corruption. Perhaps it is time for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to declare its independence before the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] crumbles completely and takes you with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1904;Yes, let us make our own way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1904;No, I am loyal to the caliph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1905;Alas, the anarchy rampant within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has claimed another victim: from your quarters in the palace, you hear that [From.GetTitledName] has declared [From.GetHerHis] independence from the caliphate in pure disgust. Naturally your court is at odds regarding what to do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1907;After the unjust murder of his son by local authorities, a follower of the Kharijite sect of Islam by the name of Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Shari has launched an insurrection in the province of Mosul, aiming to toppling the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_spouse;[Root.GetTitledName], [GetHusbandWife] of [From.GetTitledName], is dragged into the central square of [From.Capital.GetName], where a huge bonfire roars.

'King of Kings,' [From.GetSheHe] mocks, with a sharp kick to the kidneys, 'Bringer of Benefit.

[From.GetSheHeCap] raises a great scimitar, shining steel reflecting the screaming crowd, and beheads [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_pope;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged, stumbling and bloody, before a screaming crowd in [From.Capital.GetName].

'This broken old [Root.GetManWoman], covered in [Root.GetHerHis] own filth, dressed in ragged, once-fine robes, is the [Root.GetManWoman] who commanded a hundred legions of infidels to invade Dar al-Islam?

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_patriarch;[Root.GetTitledName] flinches, but does not scream, as the nails are pounded through [Root.GetHerHis] hands.

The partisans of Isma'il look to his descendants for leadership, but they are forced to keep their ancestry secret. Now, however, they are mobilizing their strength behind Imam [ismaili_revolter.GetFirstName] -- descendant of Muhummad through his daughter, Fatimah, who has surfaced from relative obscurity to lead his faithful against [ismaili_revolt_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] for control over the [ismaili_revolt_target_title.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1973;With your assumption of the Isma'ili caliphate, Isma'ili faithful from across many realms have flocked to [Root.Capital.GetName] to fight under your banner.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1976;While the line descending directly from Isma'il, the Sixth Imam of the Shi'ites, was thought to have been lost, a new claimant has arisen in the form of [Root.GetBestName]. While not a direct descendant, [Root.GetSheHe] is indeed a descendant of Fatimah and claims that is enough for [Root.GetHerHim] to carry the banner of the Isma'ilis. Many Muslim scholars disagree, but there are a great many faithful who do and may one day flock to [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1976;Thank Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1977;The Isma'ili Caliphate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1977;For many years, the Isma'ili Muslims believed that their Imam was in occultation, but now [Root.GetFirstName] has claimed not only to be the descendant of Isma'il but with his successful conquest of [conquered_title.GetName] has declared himself the Caliph as well. Many of the Isma'ilis support his claim, while others support a leader by the name of Hamdan al-Qarmat who claims [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to be but an imposter. These 'Qarmatians' claim no allegiance to the new Caliph, saying he must be torn down at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2000;[Root.Educator.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has spoken to you a great deal about the ideals behind the Cathar faith, and how one who aspires to be closer to God must conduct themselves. [Root.Educator.GetHerHisCap] words have made a great impact upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_emf_heresy_2011;The Council of [council_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2011;A Cathar heresy has been brewing for some time, begun by numerous ascetic priests who espouse strange beliefs regarding there being two Gods--a 'Good God' who created the spiritual realm, and an 'Evil God' who created the material realm and all of humanity, and the reason why all humans are filled with sin--but with the gathering of these priests at a council in the province of [From.GetName], the heresy has begun to spread like wildfire. At this council, the priests codified many of their laws and spread territories into 'bishoprics', and they have since gained many followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2011;Another heresy? In MY lands?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_emf_heresy_2014;The Cathar Patriarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2014;The growing power of the Cathar Church has led it to organize itself as a reflection of the Catholic Church.

He speaks out against the greed and excess of Catholic priests, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the over-emphasis of reverence paid to Christian idols. Many peasants, having no love for the corrupt priests of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], have embraced his teachings and the Lollard heresy is spreading like wildfire throughout the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2017;Translation of the Bible;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2017;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the Catholic Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of Latin. A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Fortunately, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s Bible is considered to be a fine translation: clear, easy to read, and already quite popular with the common man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Unfortunately for [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHis] new Bible is not only considered something of a poor translation -- with far too many parts obviously swayed by the politics of the day -- it is mostly mocked outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and mostly disregarded. Even so, it is of great interest to many, and has aided the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName]s faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2018;We will keep working on it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2020;The death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means that [From.GetHerHis] efforts to translate the Bible into the vernacular have been put on hold.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2025;A disgruntled Catholic monk by the name of Brother Angelo has heavily criticized [Root.GetTitledName], and in so doing has rocked the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Brother Angelo denies that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is legally the pope, as [Root.GetSheHe] has abrogated the Rule of St. Francis -- which, according to his doctrine, represented the pure and simple Gospel. He has asserted that all of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s decrees are thus invalid, and that all Catholics who follow the Pope's will have lost the grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2025;The man is clearly a heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2031;The founding of the Waldensian Church was mostly underground, and the so the early initiates organized themselves into cells.

His teachings of a heresy that seems to combine Christianity with a combination of Gnostic dualism and anti-church sentiment has caught on extremely quickly in both Kossovo and the surrounding areas, presenting a challenge to [Root.GetTitledName]'s rule as well as to the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Some believe that this 'Bogomil' has reached the court of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and that [Root.GetSheHe] might even be considered a conversion to these heretical beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2115;Up until now, Bogomilist priests have all used different letters and gospels in their preaching, a result of the scattered and disparate beginnings of the faith.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2119;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced, with the construction of numerous seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] that would each train new priests in a standardized form of dogma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2120;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded today after a prominent Perfecti in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] issued a proclamation of support. The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is a [Root.GetManWoman] of piety and faith, he says, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] desires should be heeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2121;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced after the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] gave a speech in [Root.Capital.GetName] that has been widely-disseminated and complimented by pious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2122;A recent treatise written by [Root.GetTitledName] [Root.GetHerHim]self on the vital importance of Bogomilism's continued reforms has spread far and wide across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and received a lot of recognition from the faithful as being full of wisdom. Indeed, some are viewing the text as a new addition to Bogomilist canon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2123;Recently, a new sect of Bogomilist has been spreading in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], one that advocates a radically different version of the faith.

EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2123;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2123;Quietly get rid of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2124;A recent revival of Bogomilist traditionalism has taken hold in [PrimaryTitle.GetName], with numerous preachers cropping up who actively deride your efforts to reform the faith as being exactly the same sort of tyrannical structure they rebelled against in the first place. Needless to say, this has not been helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2125;A prominent Perfecti in [demand_province.GetName] has publicly begged that you slow down, if not outright stop, the process of Bogomilist reform.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2126;A set of crop failures and other disasters that has fallen one of your provinces in recent months has stirred the ire of several fiery preaches in the area.

Sadly, their words have taken hold amongst many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2127;A prominent Perfecti has recently taken issue with your desire to reform the Bogomilist faith, pointing out a number of flaws in your argument without ever actually saying outright that your intention is solely to grab power and force the faithful into compliance. To her, you are not a learned enough [Root.GetManWoman] to push such things forward, and there is no convincing her otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2128;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent victory against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a major victory for Bogomilism, and has spread the notion that perhaps the continuing reforms of the faith have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2129;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent staggering loss against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a sign that the ongoing reforms of the Bogomilist faith do not have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2130;Bogomilist Faith Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2130;In its inception, the Bogomilist faith was only loosely organized. It didn't believe in formal churches, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy -- this has all changed with the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName], whose piety and status as a Perfecti has encouraged all members of [Root.GetHerHis] faith to reconsider their resistance to feudal structures. Bogomilists across the world are now more formally organized, though many still do not consider them a true religion, and they remain opposed to any kind of formal church that emulates the Orthodox priesthood. Even so, there are many that object to even these changes, saying that Bogomilism has betrayed its own roots at a powerful [Root.GetLordLady]'s behest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2131;Bogomilist Faith Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2131;Though the faithful were hardly ready for it, Bogomilism has now been formalized as a structured religion thanks to the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName]. While many see [Root.GetHerHis] leadership and piety as being worthwhile to follow, there are many who claim [Root.GetSheHe] has dragged the faith too fast into something which too much resembles the very kind of tyrannical structures they once abandoned. Preachers throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are questioning how far this will go, and whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has not perhaps betrayed Bogomilism's principles for the sake of power. Whatever the case, Bogomilist priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2131;This is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2134;At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], [new_bogomilist_patriarch.GetTitledName] has been elected as the head of the newly-founded Bogomilist Church, Bogomilism having completely transformed itself from an Orthodox heresy into a fully-formed religion in its own right. Christian leaders elsewhere have been forced to recognize this new faith as a force in its own right, and its inception as a schism from standard Christianity rather than a true heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2134;It appears we must accept this now;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2134;Heretics or not, they are still Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2135;Construction has begun in Tyrnovo on the planned Church of St. Bogomil, a structure to rival St. Peter's Basilica or the Hagia Sophia. It will surely be a marvel of construction, and a bastion of faith for all Bogomilists across the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2135;Let us hope I live to see it finished;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2137;The Church of St. Bogomil;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2137;As evidence of just how far the Bogomilist faith has come, the Church of St. Bogomil has completed construction in the city of Tyrnovo. A majestic structure to rival even the most potent Christian cathedrals, the church has become a bastion of faith for all Bogomilists across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2137;St. Bogomil himself would be pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2600;Word of [new_martyr.GetFirstName]'s horrid death at the hands of the [martyr_killer.Religion.GetName], [martyr_killer.GetTitledName], has spread...and now you hear that [new_martyr.GetSheHe] has been declared a [new_martyr.Religion.GetName] martyr.

EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2605;Glory to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2610;The path to becoming a paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is a difficult one, and will likely take years of dedication and patience before it is rewarded -- if, indeed, it is rewarded at all. There will be many setbacks along the way, and the purification of one's soul does not come without trial, but the truly faithful could perhaps see it through to the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2610;I shall persevere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2611;With your wealth, it would not be difficult to build a [Root.Religion.GetName] church in [Root.Location.GetName], and the clergy would be very grateful. It would go a long way to showing your dedication to piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2611;Yes, that's a wonderful idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2611;No, there are enough churches;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2612;The recent outbreak of a sickness in [Root.Location.GetName] brings to mind tales of saints who administered to the sick, doing whatever they can for the poor and helpless. Your advisors are alarmed, however, expressing their worry that exposing yourself to such illness is a very bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2612;Of course I will help the sick;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2612;They are right -- it's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2613;Perhaps having heard of your efforts to treat the sick, a man riddled with disease has come to [Root.Location.GetName] asking that you lay on hands and pray to God that he be cured. One so faithful as yourself, he claims, is his best and only hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2613;I will touch him and pray;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2613;No, healing doesn't work that way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2614;You've heard rumors of a wise ascetic monk living in a remote part of [Root.Location.GetName]. Perhaps if you undertake a journey to visit the man, he could impart his wisdom upon you. It would be a difficult voyage, however, far more so since you feel you must go it alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2614;I will go at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2614;No, it's not worth the risk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2615;True dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] can not be done from a throne. If you are to be truly saintly, you must retreat to a monastery and take vows to serve God and only Him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2615;I will live my life in the service of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2615;No, I am meant for better things;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2616;There are whispers in your court that one who has so much wealth cannot truly be considered humble or charitable, and that such dedication to the material world is hardly the sign of the saintly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2616;Wealth is unimportant to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2616;What should I do? Give it all away?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2617;During your recent bout of illness, one of your maids is shocked to discover your hands bleeding -- as if you were suffering from the same wounds Jesus Christ suffered upon the cross. There is no evidence of the stigmata later, but the maid's tale has spread throughout [Root.Location.GetName] and many seem to believe it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2617;Perhaps I am truly blessed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2618;You hear that [supporting_priest.GetBestName] has declared [supporting_priest.GetHerHis] support for your quest to attain saintly status. [supporting_priest.GetHerHisCap] last sermon was dedicated to lauding your virtues, and suggesting the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful should emulate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2619;You hear that [doubting_priest.GetBestName] has been openly doubting your quest for saintly status, suggesting it is proud that motivates you and not true dedication to God. The only thing that could possibly persuade [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] is to present yourself for testing -- but would it be performed fairly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2619;Allow [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] to test me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2619;Let [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] doubt -- I do not care;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2620;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is clearly convinced of your piety and that your quest for sainthood is genuine. [doubting_priest.GetSheHeCap] begs your forgiveness, and suggests [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] will do whatever [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] can to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2621;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] declares that you are no paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and certainly no living saint. You are almost certain [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] had decided the outcome long before meeting you, and nothing you said could have persuaded [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2621;Which of us truly lacks faith, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2622;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your extreme piety and dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Your name is constantly on the lips of the priests during their sermons, as they hold you up as an example to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2623;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your dedication to knowledge and learning. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] scholar, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2624;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your charisma and dedication to diplomacy. God has bestowed upon you a light that others admire, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2625;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your martial prowess against the infidels. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] warrior, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2626;Your base lusts run contrary to everything a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should possess, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer them. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2626;I shall make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2626;No, this isn't worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2627;Your gluttunous nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2628;Your greedy nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2629;Your slothful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2630;Your envious nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2631;Your cruel nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2632;Your wrathful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2633;Pride is the deadliest sin, as it is the source of all others. If you truly aspire to be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, you will need to conquer this belief that you deserve more than others. You must prostrate yourself before God and take what judgement He decrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2634;Your deceitful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2635;You will never truly be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith until you conquer your ambition. It comes from a sense of pride, at seeking to raise yourself above others rather than to accept what God has given you. To forget one's ambitions, however, is not an easy task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2636;Your arbitrary sense of justice runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_lustful;For weeks you have tried to forget your lusts, to focus on chasteful thoughts and nothing else...but it has been no use. Not thinking such things leads to thinking of little else, until you are nearly mad from the attempt. You are cursed, and it seems nothing you do will change it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_gluttonous;For weeks you have nearly starved yourself, attempting to force yourself to be temperate as a good [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetManWoman] ought to be...but it is no use. After a late-night binge in the kitchens, you have to admit that your will has been defeated by your appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_greedy;For weeks you have been trying to be charitable, giving coins away to those in need and considering what possessions you ought to offer as gifts. Each time, however, thoughts of what you have lost dominate your mind until it nearly drives you mad. The last time a beggar asked for alms you kicked him. Sadly, it is no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_slothful;For weeks you have tried to be diligent, forcing yourself to attend to every important duty no matter how minor. It has done nothing but make you irritable, and you slowly find yourself making every excuse to do anything else. All you want to do now is sleep, and forget you ever wanted to be saintly. It's so much work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_envious;For weeks you have tried to be kind, forcing yourself to think well of others and not envy the things they have which you do not. It is all just a facade, however. The spite built up inside until you lashed out at everyone who crossed your path, and now you just feel awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_cruel;For weeks you have tried to be gentle and kind to everyone who crossed your path. Your edicts have been merciful, your sentences have been brief...but it's no use. It's as if not thinking cruel thoughts has made them ALL you can focus on. You need some time in the dungeons before you truly go mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_wroth;For weeks you have tried to control your temper. You have been patient with everyone, so patient that your courtiers frequently marvel at this change of heart. But you despise them for admiring what you know are false words. After beating a page near to death for spilling your wine, you have to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_proud;For weeks you have tried to show humility. You have complimented those who didn't truly deserve it, gave others an opportunity to act even when you knew better, tried not to be angry when things didn't go your way...but it's no use. You don't feel any different. Indeed, perhaps you're not sure *how* not to be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_deceitful;For weeks you have tried to be scrupulously honest, even regarding things that one really shouldn't be honest about. You heart isn't truly in it, however, and sometimes you find yourself winding your way around the truth like a snake. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_ambitious;For weeks you have done nothing...almost literally. You've made no plans, made no attempts to work towards your goals, and indeed have tried to forget about your goals completely. Being content just feels so unnatural, however. You can't push the ambitions from your mind, and finally have to admit defeat. It isn't working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_arbitrary;For weeks you have tried to be just in the way everyone expects. You've made every attempt to care about what's right and what's wrong, listened to your advisors, but it just seems so...pointless. You don't think you truly have a sense of justice, no matter how much you try. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2637;I will try again -- I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_lustful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties, attempting to put all lustful thoughts aside...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Perhaps whatever needs such thoughts served has been replaced by your love of God. Whatever the case, you now feel you can move forward, pure in deed as well as mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_gluttonous;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and temperance, eating lightly and avoiding excess...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Your appetite has been replaced by a love of God and, while you may never be truly temperate, you can at least rest assured your gluttonous nature has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_greedy;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and charity...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Giving to others actually feels *good*. You never thought it would, really. No-one will ever accuse you of being truly charitable, but your overwhelming desire to accumulate things for yourself seems to have passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_slothful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties...and, to your surprise, it has worked. You have never felt so alive and full of energy. Granted, it's difficult and you are exhausted all the time, but you look back on the way you were and can only shake your head at all the years wasted doing nothing useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_envious;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind thoughts...and, to your surprise, it has worked. All the spite you used to feel just seems to take so much *energy*, you now can't imagine why you did it. Nobody will accuse you of being kind, perhaps, but a little of your love of God has now spread to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_cruel;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind deeds...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Cruelty does not come quite so quickly as it used to, and it shocks you how good it feels to be generous from time to time. Perhaps such dark thoughts simply cannot survive in the light of God's love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_wroth;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and patience...and, to your surprise, it has worked. There have been no bouts of rage, no lashing out at anyone. When your old temper begins to rise, you think of God and it all seems to...melt away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_proud;Humility does not come easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to thinking of others before yourself. To your surprise, doing so feels good. The way they smile is a reward in and of itself, even if you get nothing else out of it. Perhaps this is what God's love truly means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_deceitful;For weeks you have been nothing but scrupulously honest, dedicating yourself to prayer and avoiding twisty thoughts of intrigue. To your surprise, it has worked. It has become easier and easier just to speak your heart, and you find yourself regretting the fact you ever felt the need to deceive others at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_ambitious;Putting aside your ambitions has not been easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and made no plans, and for a while it made you mad to feel so idle...and then, one morning, you just let it go. God shall provide, or shall not. Perhaps it truly is that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_arbitrary;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to dealing with supplicants in the fairest manner possible. It all seemed like such pointless work, and so aggravating, until one day you realize right and wrong isn't so complicated. God's love is justice, and knowing that makes it so much easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2638;God has given me a gift, and I shall not squander it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2639;There are those who question your mystic pursuits, wondering whether this is the act of a pious [Root.GetManWoman] of God or the dabblings of a pagan. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2639;Am I not a good Christian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2640;There are those who question your more...violent...interests, wondering whether these are the efforts of a zealous [Root.GetManWoman] of God or the darker urges of a criminal. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2640;I do what I do for God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2641;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your chaste nature becomes better-known to those around you.

EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2641;All should strive for virtue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_religion_2644;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your kind nature becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a generous ruler, untouched by the harsh world, and an example to others who seem to know only hate and cruelty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2645;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your humility becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own pride and concern for only themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2646;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your honest nature becomes better-known to those around you. Indeed, you recently told the truth to a visiting courtier when a lie would have served you far better...and the man was so impressed he told the tale far and wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2647;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your sense of justice becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a fair and wise ruler, trusting your edicts like they would almost no other, and an example to selfish rulers elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2648;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your devotion to theology has gained you a great deal of admiration. '[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is a true Christian scholar,' they say, and many eagerly await copies of your studies on God and true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2649;There are those who have questioned the voice you claim to hear, suggesting it is not Jesus but a demon, or worse. Now it seems that tide has turned, and more people in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are realizing that perhaps you do have a connection to the Divine, that you have been touched by God Himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2649;Jesus shall guide them, as he does me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2650;Through constant prayer and dedication to virtue, all the stress you feel has started to...simply melt away. Perhaps this is the peace a simpler life entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2650;I shall renew my dedication to God;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2651;It has taken time, but your devotion to prayer and virtue has lifted the dark clouds from your thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2652;You have come to realize that your devotion to drink is, in itself, a form of gluttony that simply cannot be abided. The time for abstinence has come, as difficult as it will be on your system after so many years of excess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2653;You have devoted yourself for so long to your pursuit of saintly virtue, sometimes it feels as if you make almost no progress at all. But you are getting there, slow as the path might be. You can feel yourself drawing closer to God with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2653;God forgive me my impatience;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2654;It seems as if you have been walking the path to saintly virtue forever. Can it really be achieved, or is it all some lie peddled by the priests to the gullible?

EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2654;I will not give up! I must not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2655_fail1;It is too much. Setback after setback has beset you, and it seems more and more unlikely you will ever achieve saintly virtue as you desire. It pains you to admit, but the time has come to give up on your ambition -- you are simply not the [Root.GetManWoman] of God you'd hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2655_fail2;You have literally spent years on the path to saintly virtue, but you admit to yourself there are still flaws in your character that cannot be ignored. You are a sinner in your heart, and that baser part of you cannot be banished no matter how much you try. Sadly, the time has come to give up your ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2655;I simply cannot do it any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2656;You have spent years upon the path to saintly virtue, years spent banishing your inner demons and focusing exclusively on prayer and devotion to duty.
