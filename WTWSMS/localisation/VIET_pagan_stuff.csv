shaman.1.desc;Many worries, many fears, many thoughts cloud my mind. I feel the need for advice, for counsel, for guidance, to quiet these many things that trouble me. Yes, yes - I shall go to my Shaman, and see if my ancestors, the spirits, can be contacted for advice and foresight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.1.a;I must remember to bring the proper offerings to my Shaman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.2.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] pays the Court Shaman a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.2.name;Visiting the Shaman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.2.desc;“To heal your body and soul you must be earnest and pure,” your Shaman says, pacing around you with perfectly-timed, theatrical steps. “You come to me because you are troubled. There is nothing unusual in that. The responsibilities of any leader are many. The responsibilities of any [Root.GetManWoman] are many. There is great wisdom in humbling yourself and seeking guidance from the spirits.”\nThe Shaman pauses for a bit for dramatic effect, before subsequently saying, “I will try to communicate with your ancestors on your behalf. This is a difficult task, an arduous one, but I will try my best. Tell me first, then, of the things that trouble you.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.2.a;“I am always worried about my family situation...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.2.b;“My realm’s affairs are constantly on my mind...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shaman.3.name;To the Spirit World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.3.desc;Your Shaman meticulously listens to your concerns, asking questions and noting any details as necessary, in preparation for the journey to the Spirit world. It takes your Shaman several days to prepare.\nAs the morning of that day dawns, you sit, quiet and respectful, behind the Shaman who carries a drum. With a dramatic flourish of the hand, the Shaman beats the drum - BOM. The gesture is repeated again, and again, with ever-increasing fury as the Shaman recites arcane spells and chants and goes into a trance - bom, bom, bom, BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM.\nAnd sooner than you realize it, the Shaman is lost in the Spirit world, seeking your ancestors. You hope that the Shaman will return safe and sound, with relevant guidance from the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.3.a;Bom, bom... the sounds of the drum fill my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.4.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] takes a seat nearby, carefully watching the Shaman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.4.name;The Shaman's Journey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.4.desc;It is many hours later, and your Shaman is still beating the drum, dancing, wailing, screaming, crying, speaking gibberish, as the journey through the Spirit World proceeds. The Spirit World is a dangerous place, that much you know. The dramatic movements, the theatrical sounds, the over-the-top atmosphere, it is not without reason - how else can anyone communicate with the spirits? Much less, as someone from the land of the living, weather against the strain of going into the land of the dead?\n Amazing, is it not, that despite being “here,” the Shaman is truly now far, far away, across the mountains, forests, and plains, in the unforgiving world of the spirits? Despite your impatience, you remind yourself that your Shaman will return eventually, to tell you what the spirits wish to tell you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.4.a;Waiting is all I can do, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.5.tooltip;The wait continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.5.name;The Shaman Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.5.desc;The trance rhythm - drumming, singing, yelling, wailing, dancing - begins to slow down. The Shaman almost collapses out of exhausting, but manages to stand up. You wait a few minutes to allow your Shaman some time to rest, before you engage in conversation.\n“I have returned, and the spirits have spoken,” your Shaman says, tired, yet relaxed. Your Shaman rests a moment before continuing, “The journey was arduous, but worthwhile. The spirits told me many things... where to begin?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.5.a;Go on. Take your time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.6.desc;“Your marital life is blessed for now, the spirits told me,” your Shaman says. “Harmony rules your house. But the spirits also warned that you must be cautious - a peaceful house can quickly turn violent and destructive if not carefully watched. To ensure continued prosperity you must...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.6.a;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.7.desc;“The spirits were dark when they told me,” your Shaman continues, “that much caution should be exercised with your current marital life. There may be strife if you are not careful, and one of your wisest ancestors told me that this strife may have already begun. Be very cautious.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.7.a;Oh my... so what can I do to reduce strife?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.8.desc;“You currently hold a lonely existence without a spouse, the spirits know this much,” the Shaman says. “They have said that the loneliness will end soon if you stay true to your duties as a [Root.GetManWoman] and a [Root.GetTitle]. Take heed of their advice, and you will live well with a spouse.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.8.a;My duties, huh? Tell me their advice, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.9.desc;“Your ancestors recognize that you are currently unmarried,” your Shaman tells you. “They are uncertain whether this loneliness will end, even if you do get married. You do want to avoid trouble with such relationships in the future, of course, so the ancestors have suggested some advice.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.9.a;Dead spirits always give the best love advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.10.desc;“Great things may be in store for your grown children, the spirits have said.” Your Shaman pauses, before continuing, “They believe that one of your children will prove themselves worthy. This is an auspicious time for them. Even if they died, their spirit would bring blessings to your dynasty.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.10.a;Did the spirits offer any suggestions on childbearing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.11.desc;“The spirits were most concerned about your children,” your Shaman says. “Does this mean that disaster will befall them? They do not know for certain. But what is certain is that utter care must be taken handling your children, for they are not prospering in these trying times.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.11.a;My poor children... What I can do to make things better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.12.desc;“Your bear life with no close family - or at least one that is not complete,” the Shaman says. “The spirits have given me much advice to ensure you will have children. Stay true to your duties as a [Root.GetManWoman] and a [Root.GetTitle], and you will be blessed with many children. The ancestors told me...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.12.a;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.13.desc;“The spirits seethat you currently have no children,” the Shaman says. “This is no surprise. They see many things which hinder you from garnering any offspring, which twist and pervert your fate. There are things you can try to alleviate this situation, though...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.13.a;And that would be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.14.desc;“The spirits have told me they have observed your dynasty for some time, and they wish to offer advice on dealing with your relatives,” your Shaman says. “The spirits do not mean to bode ill - on the contrary, they believe this is an opportune time to improve your dynasty’s influence.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.14.a;How can I do that, then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.15.desc;“Your ancestors have told me they have observed your dynasty for some time, and they wish to offer advice on dealing with your relatives,” your Shaman says. “This does not necessarily mean great conflict within your dynasty, but your ancestors bode caution, as it seems like your dynasty will...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.15.a;Uh-oh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.16.desc;“The spirits have studied your servants and vassals,” your Shaman explains. “Many are deceitful and dangerous. But many are also trustworthy and loyal. Know whom to trust. Reward and protect them, and they shall do the same to you. The spirits suggest you encourage them by...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.16.a;By what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.17.desc;“The spirits are fearful for your realm’s future, but more so for you as a ruler of men,” your Shaman tells, “There are many who seek to destroy you, including those servants and vassals who serve you. If you are to defend yourself, you must make changes for the better...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.17.a;These changes being...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.18.desc;“The spirits believe that your warriors shall meet many victories in battle, if war is fated to come in the new future.” Your Shaman warns, however, “But remember that advantages are but a means to victory, not victory in and of itself. Nevertheless, the spirits thought of good war plans, and told me...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.18.a;How can I defeat my enemies, if they come?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.19.desc;“Your ancestors told me this might not be a good time for battle,” your Shaman explains. “Even if you win exceptional victory, the aftermath will be of much trouble. Defeat, however, can be avoided - possibly - if you follow the spirits’ advice. They have told me that you must...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.19.a;Doesn’t sound good to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.20.desc;“The realm should prosper fine,” your Shaman tells. “So the spirits have said. There may be difficult periods, but the realm will emerge stronger so long as you focus and stay diligent. All good things can be lost if they are not carefully watched, and even then, all good things must end eventually.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.20.a;Did they suggest anything on how to continue this success?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.21.desc;“Your ancestors fear for the realm,” your Shaman says, before reassuring, “This does not necessarily mean disaster is at hand, but it does show that troubling times may come. Who is to suffer? The commoner? The merchants? The rulers? The spirits told me calamity could be prevented if...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.21.a;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.22.desc;“There are always those who plot and scheme against you, and while the spirits cannot always see what your enemies are planning, they can provide their protection and advice,” your Shaman says. “This should be a peaceful time for you, but be wary as always - hubris is a bringer of doom.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.22.a;Any suggestions on dealing with these enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.23.desc;“There are those who plot and scheme against you, and your ancestors have warned me well that this is a dangerous time for you.” The Shaman frowns, before adding, “It is difficult to change fate as it is to know it, but your ancestors told me of a few measures you can prevent disaster...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.23.a;Please, tell me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.24.desc;“Your ancestors have told me that the spiritual needs of your people are being fulfilled,” your Shaman reports happily. “Many are learned and know the proper rites and manners of interacting with the spirit world. As ruler, you must ensure this good state of affairs lasts by...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.24.a;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.25.desc;“Your ancestors were rather distrustful and unfriendly when I met them, as they believe the spiritual state of your realm is lacking at best.” Your Shaman’s grimaces. “They are, however, willing to assist you in bettering the spiritual needs of the realm if you are willing to do your part.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.25.a;What should I do then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.26.desc;“Your ancestors have observed you and saw that while you may have your flaws, there remains great potential in you as a person,” your Shaman says. “Continue respecting the spirits around you, be bountiful in merit and goodness. To improve yourself, the spirits suggested you...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.26.a;Well, what a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.27.desc;“Your ancestors seemed disappointed when I mentioned you,” your Shaman says. “All [Root.GetManWoman] have flaws, that is undeniable, but the spirits believe your recent behaviors and attitudes need to be improved even more for the betterment of your realm and yourself. They suggested...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.27.a;Well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.28.desc;“Your ancestors told me you are in good health,” your Shaman says. “Good health is no guarantee of success, but it does show that the world favors you, for now. The spirits offered me further instructions on how you can continue possessing such strength...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.28.a;Let me hear it then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.29.desc;“Your ancestors seem to be concerned about your health,” your Shaman indicates. “Perhaps there are evil spirits near you or your house. Your ancestors indicated they could help if necessary if I perform the proper rites, but they also suggested you should take certain measures...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.29.a;What measures should I take then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.30.desc;“The spirits recognize your youth,” your Shaman says. “To be young! It is a blessing, say they, but it can quickly become a curse if used unwisely. Be level-headed, not rash. Virtuous, not wicked. The ancestors have much counsel to give you - let me recount what they told me...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.30.a;What did they want to tell me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.31.desc;“Your ancestors know that you are of middle age,” your Shaman tells you. “Some may think of youth as more exciting, or of old age as more enlightening, but there is reward in middle age as well. The spirits have much advice to offer to you on how to best live your life during this time.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.31.a;Let’s hear it then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.32.desc;“There is nothing more. That is all that I have been told,” your Shaman says, after telling you many more things. “Do not forget what the spirits have said. Contemplate their messages carefully.”\nYour Shaman pauses, before continuing, “Fate is a difficult thing to understand - remember that the world is ever-changing, ever-flowing. The decisions you make today could bode well or ill. Good and bad results depend on all of us, and do not arise randomly. Everything has reason and purpose. Your ancestors’ spirits do not force absolute views on you, for they cannot. But it would be extremely unwise to ignore them. They know better than we do”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.32.name;Fate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.32.a;Very well. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.33.desc;“The spirits recognize your advanced age,” the Shaman reports. “They know that soon, you will join them. This will be a troubling time to you, full of worries about what you will leave behind, and anxiety about what you will face. Your ancestors offer you the following guidance - listen closely...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.33.a;Hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.34.desc;The humming tone of the Shaman is unmistakable, the fluidity of his movements, the tranquility of which he moves in nature... The Shaman approaches and greets you, and you stay where you are. The otherworldliness, the powers these Shamans hold - it all still mystifies and fascinates you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.34.a;Welcome to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.35.desc;I currently do not have a Shaman at my court, and it reflects badly on my rule. Who will travel to the Spirit World to ask my ancestors for advice? Who will pacify the spirits who live in my realm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaman.35.a;I must find a Shaman, and soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

haltija_good;Friendly Haltija;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haltija_good_desc;The Haltija (guardian spirits in Finnish paganism) of this province are friendly and helpful towards its people and rulers, and as such this province should prosper more than it normally would from the Haltijas' assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haltija_neutral;Neutral Haltija;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haltija_neutral_desc;The Haltija (guardian spirits in Finnish paganism) of this province are neutral towards its people and rulers, and as such this province will experience neither the benefits nor the disasters the Haltija could bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

finnish_unhappy_dead_desc;One or both of this person's parents is still traveling to Tuonela (the Finnish Pagan "Spirit World") but is unhappy for some reason, and is thus currently causing some trouble for this person. However, the troubles should end once the parents' spirit finishes traveling to Tuonela.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.1.desc;Now that I am dead, I shall be traveling to Tuonela, the spirit world! Hopefully my family and friends will cope with the loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.1.a;I hope my children know what they’re doing too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.2.tooltip;Your children prepare the funeral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.2.desc;The funeral procession of your recently deceased parent, [From.GetTitledFirstName], continues to the burial site. On the way, you stop below a chosen tree. Here you make a karsikko marking to remind your parent’s soul that they are no longer among the living. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.2.a;Hopefully [From.GetHerHis] soul will remember and not cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.3.desc;It is time for the great bear hunt and the bear feast, Karhunpeijaiset! You gather all the willing men of your court. As you all prepare for an arduous journey to the den many days away, you all begin to sing the first ritual song. “Where was the Bear born, honeypaw turned around?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.3.a;“High up in the heavens on the Great Bear’s shoulders...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.4.tooltip;Preparations for the great Bear hunt are made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.4.name;To the Bear Den;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.4.desc;After several days of preparing, you and your men are ready. The whole journey must be easier for you than the young orphan girl who follows you and the other hunters. This chosen girl is to represent and symbolize the bear’s bride and entice the bear to come outside its den - it would be a disaster to kill a sleeping bear inside its den, a sacrilegious act akin to a thousand murders. The bear must be killed in the heat of battle.\nAs you all walk away from the village, into the wilderness, you and the men sing the proper songs and hymns to the girl: “Come, Maiden, be our journey’s guide! Pitiful one, be our companion. Take us to the hillock, where the where the pines gleam red, and silver are the fir tree branches...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.4.a;Let’s do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.5.tooltip;The journey to the Bear's den begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.5.name;Get up, Get Out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.5.desc;A few days later, you finally come upon the bear’s den. The girl has already gone in, singing a hymn, “Forest, favor your hunters! Get up, get out, sooty fellow, get up from the sooty fire...” As you wait, you cannot shake off the feeling of tiredness. Still, you know this is an important task, and you manage keep yourself awake.\n At last, the orphan girl has done her task in awakening the bear, who shouts a mighty roar. The girl scurries outside and behind your men to safety, and the bear follows, charging out of its den. You and the hunters prepare for battle, and you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.5.a;Charge headfirst at the head of your men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.5.b;Stay by the side of your men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.5.c;Try to stay in the back with the young girl and not get hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

finnish.6b.tooltip;You fight the bear along with your men;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.6c.tooltip;You act like a coward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.6.name;We Didn't Kill the Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.6.desc;Glorious! The bear has been killed. But before all of you can celebrate, you must all tell the bear that it was slain not by the hunters, but in an accident. This is so the bear’s soul will be happy so it can reincarnate properly - otherwise, the hunt and feast will be in vain.\n“It wasn’t I who met you, the bear, or any the rest of my mates,” you sing, along with the other men. “You, yourself, fell off the spruce, slipped from the bent bough yourself, pierced your berry-filled belly, shattered your golden maw...” Hopefully you will convince the bear’s soul for now, but only a proper ceremony back home during the Karhunpeijaiset will ensure for certain that the bear’s soul is placated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.6.a;It’s time to go back home, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.7.tooltip;The journey back home begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.7.name;The One with Rough Fur Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.7.desc;The journey home was even more arduous, though more so because you had to carry the bear’s corpse back and mark your route by slicing off slivers of tree bark. But eventually, you make your way back home, where you are greeted by the whole community.\n“The one with rough fur has arrived!” you and your men shout, careful not to say the actual word for ‘bear’ (the word for such a holy animal is only properly used during hymns after all). “The one with rough fur has arrived! Make way, boys and girls, make way!”\nMeanwhile, some people speak to the bear, to ensure, once more, that its spirit is happy. “We have been awaiting your arrival!” “We are delighted to have you with us!” “Oh, great one with rough fur, we have prepared a lavish feast in your honor!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.7.a;Now let’s bring it inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.8.tooltip;The great bear feast, Karhunpeijaiset, soon begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.8.name;Karhunpeijaiset;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.8.desc;Thankfully everyone back home prepared well for the feast while you and the men were away. It is only a short wait before the bear is cooked. The bear’s head, the skull dish, is placed first at the top of the table before you - the bear’s head is the most sacred, so it is only proper. Then, the other dishes are placed, including the main meal, a special pea soup made with the bear’s head, paws, and other magical parts of its body.\nAs you and everyone else feasts, you all sing a hymn. “I'll take the Bear’s ear for my own ear, along with the ear before, to sharpen my own hearing...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.8.a;“I'll take the Bear’s nose and leave him with no scent...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.9.tooltip;The feasting continues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.9.name;Burying the Bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.9.desc;The feast is finished after many days of eating and drinking. There too were many amusements, and everyone (including you) had to perform something for everyone else, be it singing, storytelling, joking, or something else. Nevertheless, the Bear’s body has been picked clean, with nothing but bones left. These bones must be buried, while the skull will be placed high on the branches of a special ‘kallohonka’ or skull tree.\nEveryone sings the proper hymns as the bear’s skull and bones are carried to the designated burial site. “Golden one, get on your way, money precious get moving, along the golden lane, along the silver road! You'll not be taken far from here...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.9.a;“Just to a pine tree on a hill, a juniper at the field's far edge...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.10.tooltip;The Karhunpeijaiset comes to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.10.desc;So ends the bear hunt and Karhunpeijaiset or bear feast. You, the hunters, the accompanying orphan girl, and everyone else congratulate each other on a job well done. The bear’s skull will stay on the pine tree for years to come, and remind all of this moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.10.a;It is time to return to normal life, unfortunately...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.11.desc;The local shamans have identified the local Haltija, or guardian spirits, who protect the province of [Root.GetName]. You’ve just visited there to give them offerings and pray that they will prove amiable and helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.11.a;Let’s hope this works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.12.desc;The province of [Root.GetName] was once controlled by Finnish Pagans who believed in the Haltija, or guardian spirits. However, our beliefs have nothing to do with such superstition, and there is no need to appease these “spirits” no matter what the peasants say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.12.a;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.13.desc;Local shamans from the province of [Root.GetName] report that the Haltija, or guardian spirits, are becoming more and more receptive to our presence there. This is perhaps a good thing, as kind and cooperative Haltija ensure that the land will prosper and the people live in peace and stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.13.a;Let us hope this continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.14.desc;Local shamans from the province of [Root.GetName] report that the Haltija, or guardian spirits, are becoming less and less welcoming of our presence there. What sort of things could have gone wrong? While this does not entail disaster, we must remain cautious and friendly towards the Haltija there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.14.a;Hopefully the situation changes soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.15.desc;In order to improve your relationship with the Haltija throughout your demesne, you have decided to make some offerings to them. You decide to gather beautiful flowers, fragrant wood, good food, and whatever else you can think of in preparation for this offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.15.a;Hopefully this works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.16.tooltip;You, the Shamans, and other important persons gather to make the offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.16.desc;You and your Shaman, along with a few others, gather before the sacred site and make the offerings to the Haltija. You all chant hymns and praise the Haltija, before retiring for the night. Several days later, your Shaman comes to you to duly report how the Haltija thought of the gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.16.a;Did they like it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.17.tooltip;The Haltija reject the offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.17.desc;Your Shaman tells you that the Haltija throughout your demesne rejected your offerings, and do not appreciate what they view as a dishonest attempt to appease them. This does not mean they will be malevolent towards us, but we should not expect our relationship with them to improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.17.a;Not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.18.tooltip;The Haltija accept the offerings but are neutral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.18.desc;Your Shaman reports that while the Haltija throughout your demesne accepted your offerings, they still seem to be a bit reluctant to change their current stance with us. At the least, they do appear to appreciate the gifts. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.18.a;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.19.tooltip;The Haltija appreciate the offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.19.desc;Your Shaman says that the Haltija throughout your demesne seem to be very receptive to your offerings and appreciate your gesture of goodwill. Perhaps your relationship with them will continue to improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.19.a;Great to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.20.tooltip;Your parent's soul is unhappy despite your efforts and might cause a bit of trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.20.name;An Unhappy Soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.20.desc;Your deceased parent continues to stir up trouble despite your karsikko marking. Why is the soul coming back unhappy? The local Shamans say it doesn’t seem to be too serious a case, and once your parent’s soul calms down, they should be able to go to the spirit world, Tuonela, peacefully.\nUntil then, however, the Shamans say you should try to show as much respect as you can, to reassure and pacify the soul. For instance, you and your relatives will not speak ill of the deceased, and doing small sacrifices and offerings here and there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.20.a;I hope this all works!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.21.tooltip;It's time to put the Bear's skull up on the Kallohonka tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.21.name;Kallohonka - the Skull Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.21.desc;The bones have been buried, but the skull must be placed upon a tree to help deliver the bear’s soul back to the heavens, where it can then reincarnate back to the earth where it can walk again. You and the rest of the hunters come before the bear, and sing once more to reassure the bear that you did not wickedly slay it, and that the bear had been treated honorably as befits such a holy animal.\nYou continue your singing as the skull is carefully raised to the top of the pine tree. “I set this bear on a pure clean tree, right in the smallest pine, a fir tree with a hundred sprigs. I set it there to watch the moon, I set it there to fix its eyes on the sun...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.21.a;“I set it there to know the Great Bear in the sky...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.22.desc;The orphan girl who accompanies you and your men - she’s pretty. Really pretty. And she’s quite young, too. Indecent thoughts (some rather vivd) have filled your mind for the last few days about this fair virgin. Seducing her would be too easy, and since she’s a peasant, there won’t be any consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.22.a;No. I’m on a holy journey, I cannot do this... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.22.b;It’s time to make my move, hehe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.23.tooltip;My fantasies shall become reality...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.23.desc;As you figured, the orphan girl fell for you and your honeyed words. She has no experience with men, does she? One night, you and the girl sneak away to a secluded area of the forest. Setting her gently on the ground, you say sweet nothings while admiring her lovely form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.23.a;Let me teach you a few things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.24.desc;The orphan girl who accompanies you and your men proves to be a very spiritual sort. She’s always praying or chanting hymns - no wonder she was chosen for this! While talking with her by the campfire one night, she says how grateful she is for this opportunity to be part of this great event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.24.a;The gods will be honored by your presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.24.b;This probably doesn’t do much for the gods to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.25.desc;To your surprise, the orphan girl who accompanied you appears to be quite skilled in handling bow and arrow. “My father was a skilled hunter. He taught me a lot before he died,” she explains. “I know it’s not my place to actually hunt the bear, but I can teach you a few of my father’s tricks.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.25.a;Sure, that sounds great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.26.desc;“Look what you’ve done,” one of the men tell me, “You’ve made the girl cry and run away. How are we supposed to hunt the bear if we don’t have an orphan girl? Since you were the one who mocked her, you should go and find her.” Bah! I can be a lot worse if I want to, but come on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.26.a;What a moronic wench, that orphan girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.27.tooltip;Now which direction did that girl run off in again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.27.desc;I find the orphan sitting on a tree stump a far distance away. She notices me as I approach and turns away, probably scared. Gah! How troublesome, that I have to be so gentle and soft, just because she’s that important. Still, maybe I should really apologize. I kind of feel bad for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.27.a;Nah, I’m not that soft. I shout, “Get back here, you wench!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.27.b;I sit down next to her to make my first honest apology in a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.28.desc;There’s something about the orphan girl accompanying you and the men that you find attractive. Not in a lustful way, of course, but as a person, one who invites a lot of sympathy. For an orphaned peasant, and a young one, she’s been through and seen a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.28.a;She’s a real survivor, she is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.29.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] befriends the orphan and gets to know her better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.29.desc;You and the orphan girl seem to get along pretty well, despite the difference in age and social status. She seems like a really gifted child of sharp mind and pure heart. “I’m glad you were chosen for this task,” you tell her. “A clever and kind woman is the one needed for something like this.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.29.a;I admit her smile is kind of infectious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.30.tooltip;I should do something for this girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.30.desc;You decide to give the orphan some of your belongings and valuables as a gift. A good person like her needs all the help she can get. Though she refuses your gift at first, she finally relents and happily accepts your help. It’s the least you can do for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.30.a;I hope it’ll serve you well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.31.desc;It’s been a while since the Karhunpeijaiset, but lately I’ve been thinking about the orphan girl I befriended. Quite precocious and sweet, she was. Can she survive out there, even with the rather generous gift I gave? I think I have to seek her out and see how she’s doing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.31.a;Where to start?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.32.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] tries to find out where the orphan girl lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.32.desc;Thankfully the peasants I met were rather helpful, and I was able to quickly locate the orphan girl, who lived in a little shack at the edge of a small village. She is shocked to see you, but greets you and your guards warmly, if a little embarrassingly, given the meagre state she lives in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.32.a;Your house is very... um... nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.33.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] talks with the orphan for a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.33.desc;My chat with the orphan goes by pleasantly. Suddenly, she says, beaming, “You’ve been so kind to me. You remind me of my father, who was a very kind man, though I don’t remember much about him.” At that moment, an indescribable, uncontrollable emotion overwhelms me, though I manage to hide it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.33.a;This child can’t live by herself like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.34.tooltip;Perhaps I should adopt her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.34.desc;My heart is set. If this orphan were a boy, I might not be able to do this without some political consequences, but I think I’ll adopt her. She’s kind and clever, and doesn’t deserve to live alone and impoverished like this. Being so sharp, she’ll easily learn how to act like a proper daughter of a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish.34.a;I tell her, “You won’t have to live like this much longer...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
