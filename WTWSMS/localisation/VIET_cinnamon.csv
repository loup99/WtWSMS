VIETmisc.5000.desc;It's no secret. I'm in love with cinnamon. When I was younger I didn't eat too much of it, but when I did, I enjoyed it greatly. Now that I am older, I can procure as much cinnamon as my treasury can handle. I like the swirls of spicy and sweet in every bite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5000.a;Who can't see why I love the taste of cinnamon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.tooltip;There's nothing like cinnamon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.title;A Taste of Cinnamon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.desc;I have a feast coming up. All my vassals will be there, and many other important nobles of the realm. We will celebrate life and have a good time, and I intend to do that by serving everybody as many savory and sweet cinnamon dishes as possible, including my favorite - cinnamon toasted sticky buns. Everyone will see why I love the taste of cinnamon.\n\nUnfortunately cinnamon is an expensive delicacy. The cost for this otherwise mundane feast will be a bit high. But I crave those crazy spices! I just crave them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.a;The feast will be cinnamon themed, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.tooltip;I can hardly wait! In the meanwhile, I'll eat some cinnamon toasted sticky buns...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.title;Cinnamon, Cinnamon Everywhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.desc;The food at the feast was delicious! Cinnamon oil to cook everything in. Cinnamon and garlic flavored fish. Cinnamon sprinkled in soups. Cinnamon in meat pies and sweet pies. Cinnamon spread on bread and fruit. And my favorite, cinnamon and honey-syrup slathered sticky buns! In fact I can't even remember what didn't have cinnamon at the feast.\n\nApparently some of my guests appreciated my tastes. Others didn't, however. I could see it in their eyes. The way their eyes shifted around when they looked at they food. The way they slowly ate it.\n\nHow sad, that there are people who cannot appreciate cinnamon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.a;Some of my courtiers seemed weary and concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.tooltip;They seriously think I'm overdoing things. Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.title;Cuckoo for Cinnamon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.desc;A few of my courtiers told me they were concerned about my eating habits. I eat cinnamon with everything, they claimed! But that of course is certainly not true. I definitely eat other things, I argued.\n\nThey were insistent, however. They said eating too much cinnamon wasn't a good thing, despite whatever healing benefits it may have had, and that I'd regret my irrational addiction.\n\nBut the thing is, I really do eat other things. Do people think I'm insane just because I had a cinnamon-themed feast? Can't they see why I love the taste of cinnamon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.a;That appears to be the case, tragically...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.tooltip;I'm feeling like some cinnamon toasted sticky buns for breakfast for tomorrow, anyhow. Or the next few days. Or weeks. I'll have breakfast on a whole other level!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.title;Midas Fingers of Cinnamon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.desc;Maybe wanting the taste of cinnamon in the morning wasn't a good idea. After eating some cinnamon toasted sticky buns (my favorite cinnamon food), my hands were so sticky, and I got cinnamon and honey-syrup all over my fine robes, my face, my chair... everything I touch becomes a mess! However I have an important meeting with my councillors right now, and I don't want to be late - what can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.a;I'll go to the meeting, I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.tooltip;Hopefully my councillors won't be too irritated with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.title;They're Great! (Really!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.desc;The meeting went alright, though my sticky cinnamon-covered fingers were a distraction. Thankfully I managed to prevent the stickiness from spreading everywhere. My councillors, instead of being irritated at me, found my situation hilarious. They made fun of not only me, but worse, of cinnamon itself! It appears now that everyone in my court is making fun of me.\n\nHow can someone as high as myself be the laughstock of the entire realm, simply because I love the taste of cinnamon? My courtiers and vassals always plot and see everything I do. But can they see why I love the taste of cinnamon toast sticky buns?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.a;They will understand. They just have to. The swirls of spicy and sweet cinnamon in every bite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.tooltip;I still must try to convince someone that cinnamon is the greatest food ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.title;The Taste I Can See;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.desc;I tried to explain to my courtiers. I really did! Cinnamon is so wonderful. Why wouldn't anyone love it? Everything simply tastes better with it, whether it's eggs, waffles, sausages, beans, sweet buns, milk, or water... anything really. Even peasant gruel tastes like heavenly nectar if I add some cinnamon too it.\n\nBut no. No one understood. I asked them why cinnamon was so great. Why I had to like it. But no one came up with the right answers, and I must resign to the fact that no one will know why I love the taste of cinnamon. Why I love the taste of cinnamon toasted sticky buns, especially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.a;It's because there's a swirl of delicious cinnamon flavor in every bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5007.desc;I am traveling with some of my soldiers, on a mission to hunt some bandits terrorizing the countryside in a part of my realm, when we see a quaint town in the distance. We decide to stay there for the night, as it is very close to where we believe the outlaws are, and it would make a good base for us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5007.a;This place better have better food than that last village we stayed at.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5008.desc;The innkeeper of the town's only inn is surprised that such a person of high status is staying at his inn, but he does his best to make me comfortable. He offers me the local delicacy - a vegetable omelette of sorts - for dinner, and I accept. Surely this peasant cooking will taste passable at best, I thought at first.\n\nThe innkeeper's daughter (the ugliest wench I ever had the misfortune to see) brings out the plate to me. It looks pathetic - a pale yellow fold, decorated rather haphazardly with some colorless vegetables. Pity these peasants who can't afford much meat!\n\nNot expecting much, I pick up the omelette, and put it in my mouth, and slowly chew on it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5008.a;I... wait a moment... this is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5009.tooltip;THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS THING I HAVE EVER EATEN!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5009.title;Of Omelettes and Men;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5009.desc;as difficult to fall asleep after eating that vegetable omelette. How could a simple peasant recipie be so delicious? I had to find out. And with that thought in mind, I drifted off to sleep and strange dreams of cooked eggs and steamed vegetables.\n\nThe next day, as my men and I prepare to leave the town, ready to hunt and kill the bandits, I ask the innkeeper what exactly made his omelette so tasty. He shrugs, and humbly tells me that he simply uses eggs, vegetables, and some herbs he gets from the other townspeople. Unfortunately, I learn, they aren't making as many omelettes as they used to, because the bandits (the very ones I am hunting) stole many of their chickens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5009.a;I will kill the bandits and return your chickens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.tooltip;And then I'll be able to eat another delicious vegetable omelette as a reward, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.title;Attacking the Bandits' Lair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.desc;My men and I scout the area, searching through the wilderness where seemingly dwells nothing but scattered wildlife. But we eventually find signs of the bandits. "Their lair should be around in that direction," one of my scouts reports.\n\nMy men and I slowly descend down a steep crevice into the valley where the bandits dwell, careful not to make any sound, our weapons held tightly in our hands. Up ahead, we see the faint outlines of makeshift camps, scattered loot, the bandits we were meant to hunt, and a lot of chickens.\n\nWe slowly ease towards our enemies, until we come very close. It's only time now before I raise the signal and tell -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.a;Oh no! The chickens noticed us and are making a lot of noise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.tooltip;Damn you chickens! I'll eat all your eggs later, I swear!;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.title;Chickens and Chickens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.desc;The chickens ruined our element of surprise, but my men and I fearlessly rush into battle nevertheless. Blood spatters everywhere, as we and the bandits do battle. They put up a decent fight, but their morale wavers and they begin to flee. The cowards! Soon enough, all of them lie dead, the entire valley filled with nothing but their corpses, their loot, and a huddle of chickens.\n\nI order my men to collect the loot and chickens. In my mind, I have a feeling I'll be eating a very delicious meal tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.a;I'll be having more vegetable omelettes tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.tooltip;Oy, you there! Careful with those eggs you are carrying!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.title;The Chicken Rescuers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.desc;As we come back to the town and return the chickens, we are greeted by the grateful inhabitants, who hail us as savior and heroes. Where can one find a lord who cares so much for his people, that he would personally go and return that which was stolen from them?\n\nI meet with the innkeeper again, hoping to eat another of his omelettes. However, I suddenly have an even better idea, and decide to ask him a favor (or, perhaps, make a demand). "Gather all the eggs you can and cook a great omelette, a large one large enough to feed me, all my men, and the entire town!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.a;He agrees to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5013.title;It's...it's so big!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5013.desc;I don't know how he did it - I admit in my moment of passion I made a bit of a difficult request - but the innkeeper somehow managed to pull it off, and just in time for dinner. In the town square, atop a mass of tables and other furniture designed to hold it, lay the gigantic omelette, big enough to feed several hundred people - everyone present, essentially, including me, my men, and the entire town.\n\nWe feast on the glorious omelette, and have a splendid time, dancing and laughing and playing games until the wee hours of the night. But mostly, it was the omelette I enjoyed the most. I probably ate several meals' worth of omelettes, to be honest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5013.a;Too bad I have to go home tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5014.tooltip;There just has to be a way I can enjoy these vegetable omelettes at home.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5014.desc;The next morning, as I am about to leave, the innkeeper tells me that the townspeope he decided to hold a special festival of eggs (and omelettes) every year to honor what happened. I also ask the innkeeper if he can provide me a recipie for his omelette.\n\nThe innkeeper says he has a better idea. "My daughter has always wanted to leave this town. She knows my recipie very well so why don't you allow her to come to your court as an assistant to your cook? She knows how to prepare other delicious dishes, too."\n\nI have to ponder his suggestion as the girl is extremely hideous. So hideous I am afraid my courtiers would have nightmares, to put it politely. Would they accept an ugly commoner cooking their food?;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5015.desc;Bat bones are said to bring a lot of luck, according to Cretan folklore. I don’t know whether having some by my side would bring me any fortune, but it should at least leave a good impression on my Cretan subjects. I’ll go look for some!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5015.a;Not to mention it’s a good excuse to get some fresh air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5016.title;Finding Bat Bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.desc;Cretan folklore says that to kill a bat is a terrible thing and will cause much bad luck, and thus one has to be careful when looking for bat bones inside caves - you don’t want to end up killing one of the bats still alive!\n\nUp ahead, I see the cave I wish to enter. Locals have told me this cave contains a lot of bats.\n\nLooks like there’s no turning back now, huh?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.a;In I go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.b;I’m... starting to have second thoughts... the cave looks scary and dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5018.desc;I make my way through the cave, torch in hand, and eventually find some bat bones. Thank goodness!\n\nAs I dig deeper, I find other things as well - tiny bits of what must have been marble and stone blocks, some metal pots and scraps, and even a few pottery shards decorated with paintings of bulls. Maybe there was once an underground temple to a pagan bull god of sorts, once.\n\nAs I collect some bat bones and I continue digging, and come across something strange. ”These aren’t bat bones...” I mutter. “Aren’t those... bite marks... on human skeletons?!?!?”\n\nSuddenly, I hear some heavy breathing nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5018.a;Damn it, the fire on my torch just went out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5019.tooltip;Are those... red eyes... staring at me?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5019.title;Man? Or Bull?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Who are you?” I shout. “Show yourself!” I absentmindedly raise the bat bones in front of me, thinking it’s my torch.\n\nI hear a most unearthly, horrifying sound coming from the bull - I think it is a bull now, is it? The creature, or person, or whatever it is walks away, into the darkness, leaving me alone once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5019.a;Did the... did the bat bones do something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5020.desc;I am temporarily blinded by the sunlight as I make my way out the cave.

All I know is that these bat bones are indeed lucky. They protected me and scared way that beast!\n\nSighing, I make my way back home, clutching tightly on the bat bones.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5020.a;Perhaps I encountered a bull-like monster? Quite an encounter then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5020.b;It was probably just a bear, and my imagination overexaggerated things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

My misfortune is that I have been in Dunhuang for three years thanks to you, and there was a way out a first, a second, even a fifth time, but he refused to bring me out.”\n\nThe rest of the letter is unreadable.;;;;;;;;;;;x

When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, careful inquiry is to be made, and a decision is to be made according to law.
