VIETmisc.5000.desc;It's no secret. I'm in love with cinnamon. When I was younger I didn't eat too much of it, but when I did, I enjoyed it greatly. Now that I am older, I can procure as much cinnamon as my treasury can handle. I like the swirls of spicy and sweet in every bite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5000.a;Who can't see why I love the taste of cinnamon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.tooltip;There's nothing like cinnamon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.title;A Taste of Cinnamon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.desc;I have a feast coming up. All my vassals will be there, and many other important nobles of the realm. We will celebrate life and have a good time, and I intend to do that by serving everybody as many savory and sweet cinnamon dishes as possible, including my favorite - cinnamon toasted sticky buns. Everyone will see why I love the taste of cinnamon.\n\nUnfortunately cinnamon is an expensive delicacy. The cost for this otherwise mundane feast will be a bit high. But I crave those crazy spices! I just crave them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5001.a;The feast will be cinnamon themed, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.tooltip;I can hardly wait! In the meanwhile, I'll eat some cinnamon toasted sticky buns...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.title;Cinnamon, Cinnamon Everywhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.desc;The food at the feast was delicious! Cinnamon oil to cook everything in. Cinnamon and garlic flavored fish. Cinnamon sprinkled in soups. Cinnamon in meat pies and sweet pies. Cinnamon spread on bread and fruit. And my favorite, cinnamon and honey-syrup slathered sticky buns! In fact I can't even remember what didn't have cinnamon at the feast.\n\nApparently some of my guests appreciated my tastes. Others didn't, however. I could see it in their eyes. The way their eyes shifted around when they looked at their food. The way they slowly ate it.\n\nHow sad, that there are people who cannot appreciate cinnamon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5002.a;Some of my courtiers seemed weary and concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.tooltip;They seriously think I'm overdoing things. Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.title;Cuckoo for Cinnamon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.desc;A few of my courtiers told me they were concerned about my eating habits. I eat cinnamon with everything, they claimed! But that of course is certainly not true. I definitely eat other things, I argued.\n\nThey were insistent, however. They said eating too much cinnamon wasn't a good thing, despite whatever healing benefits it may have, and that I'd regret my irrational addiction.\n\nBut the thing is, I really do eat other things. Do people think I'm insane just because I had a cinnamon-themed feast? Can't they see why I love the taste of cinnamon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5003.a;That appears to be the case, tragically...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.tooltip;I'm feeling like some cinnamon toasted sticky buns for breakfast for tomorrow, anyhow. Or the next few days. Or weeks. I'll have breakfast on a whole other level!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.title;Midas Fingers of Cinnamon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.desc;Maybe wanting the taste of cinnamon in the morning wasn't a good idea. After eating some cinnamon toasted sticky buns (my favorite cinnamon food), my hands were so sticky, and I got cinnamon and honey-syrup all over my fine robes, my face, my chair... everything I touch becomes a mess! However, I have an important meeting with my councillors right now, and I don't want to be late - what can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5004.a;I'll go to the meeting, I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.tooltip;Hopefully my councillors won't be too irritated with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.title;They're Great! (Really!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.desc;The meeting went alright, though my sticky cinnamon-covered fingers were a distraction. Thankfully I managed to prevent the stickiness from spreading everywhere. My councillors, instead of being irritated at me, found my situation hilarious. They made fun of not only me, but worse, of cinnamon itself! It appears now that everyone in my court is making fun of me.\n\nHow can someone as high as myself be the laughstock of the entire realm, simply because I love the taste of cinnamon? My courtiers and vassals always plot and see everything I do. But can they see why I love the taste of cinnamon toast sticky buns?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5005.a;They have to understand. The swirls of spicy and sweet cinnamon in every bite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.tooltip;I still must try to convince someone that cinnamon is the greatest food ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.title;The Taste I Can See;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.desc;I tried to explain to my courtiers. I really did! Cinnamon is so wonderful. Why would anyone not love it? Everything simply tastes better with it, whether it's eggs, waffles, sausages, beans, sweet buns, milk, or water... anything really. Even peasant gruel tastes like heavenly nectar if I add some cinnamon too it.\n\nBut no. No one understood. I asked them why cinnamon was so great. Why I had to like it. But no one came up with the right answers, and I must resign myself to the fact that no one will know why I love the taste of cinnamon. Why I love the taste of cinnamon toasted sticky buns, especially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5006.a;It's because there's a swirl of delicious cinnamon flavor in every bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5007.desc;I am traveling with some of my soldiers, on a mission to hunt some bandits terrorizing the countryside in a part of my realm, when we see a quaint town in the distance. We decide to stay there for the night, as it is very close to where we believe the outlaws are, and it would make a good base for us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5007.a;This place better have better food than that last village we stayed at.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5008.desc;The innkeeper of the town's only inn is surprised that such a person of high status is staying at his inn, but he does his best to make me comfortable. He offers me the local delicacy - a vegetable omelette of sorts - for dinner, and I accept. Surely this peasant cooking will taste passable at best, I thought at first.\n\nThe innkeeper's daughter (the ugliest wench I ever had the misfortune to see) brings out the plate to me. It looks pathetic - a pale yellow fold, decorated rather haphazardly with some colorless vegetables. Pity these peasants who can't afford much meat!\n\nNot expecting much, I pick up the omelette, and put it in my mouth, and slowly chew on it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5008.a;I... wait a moment... this is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5009.tooltip;THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS THING I HAVE EVER EATEN!;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5009.desc;as difficult to fall asleep after eating that vegetable omelette. How could a simple peasant recipie be so delicious? I had to find out. And with that thought in mind, I drifted off to sleep and strange dreams of cooked eggs and steamed vegetables.\n\nThe next day, as my men and I prepare to leave the town, ready to hunt and kill the bandits, I ask the innkeeper what exactly made his omelette so tasty. He shrugs, and humbly tells me that he simply uses eggs, vegetables, and some herbs he gets from the other townspeople. Unfortunately, I learn, they aren't making as many omelettes as they used to, because the bandits (the very ones I am hunting) stole many of their chickens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5009.a;I will kill the bandits and return your chickens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.tooltip;And then I'll be able to eat another delicious vegetable omelette as a reward, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.title;Attacking the Bandits' Lair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.desc;My men and I scout the area, searching through the wilderness where seemingly dwells nothing but scattered wildlife. But we eventually find signs of the bandits. "Their lair should be around in that direction," one of my scouts reports.\n\nMy men and I slowly descend down a steep crevice into the valley where the bandits dwell, careful not to make any sound, our weapons held tightly in our hands. Up ahead, we see the faint outlines of makeshift camps, scattered loot, the bandits we were meant to hunt, and a lot of chickens.\n\nWe slowly ease towards our enemies, until we come very close. It's only time now before I raise the signal and tell -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5010.a;Oh no! The chickens noticed us and are making a lot of noise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.tooltip;Damn you chickens! I'll eat all your eggs later, I swear!;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.title;Chickens and Chickens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.desc;The chickens ruined our element of surprise, but my men and I fearlessly rush into battle nevertheless. Blood spatters everywhere, as we and the bandits do battle. They put up a decent fight, but their morale wavers and they begin to flee. The cowards! Soon enough, all of them lie dead, the entire valley filled with nothing but their corpses, their loot, and a huddle of chickens.\n\nI order my men to collect the loot and chickens. In my mind, I have a feeling I'll be eating a very delicious meal tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5011.a;I'll be having more vegetable omelettes tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.tooltip;Oy, you there! Careful with those eggs you are carrying!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.title;The Chicken Rescuers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.desc;As we come back to the town and return the chickens, we are greeted by the grateful inhabitants, who hail us as savior and heroes. Where can one find a lord who cares so much for his people, that he would personally go and return that which was stolen from them?\n\nI meet with the innkeeper again, hoping to eat another of his omelettes. However, I suddenly have an even better idea, and decide to ask him a favor (or, perhaps, make a demand). "Gather all the eggs you can and cook a great omelette, a large one large enough to feed me, all my men, and the entire town!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5012.a;He agrees to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5013.title;It's...it's so big!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5013.desc;I don't know how he did it - I admit in my moment of passion I made a bit of a difficult request - but the innkeeper somehow managed to pull it off, and just in time for dinner. In the town square, atop a mass of tables and other furniture designed to hold it, lay the gigantic omelette, big enough to feed several hundred people - everyone present, essentially, including me, my men, and the entire town.\n\nWe feast on the glorious omelette, and have a splendid time, dancing and laughing and playing games until the wee hours of the night. But mostly, it was the omelette I enjoyed the most. I probably ate several meals' worth of omelettes, to be honest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5013.a;Too bad I have to go home tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5014.tooltip;There just has to be a way I can enjoy these vegetable omelettes at home.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5014.desc;The next morning, as I am about to leave, the innkeeper tells me that the townspeope he decided to hold a special festival of eggs (and omelettes) every year to honor what happened. I also ask the innkeeper if he can provide me a recipie for his omelette.\n\nThe innkeeper says he has a better idea. "My daughter has always wanted to leave this town. She knows my recipie very well so why don't you allow her to come to your court as an assistant to your cook? She knows how to prepare other delicious dishes, too."\n\nI have to ponder his suggestion as the girl is extremely hideous. So hideous I am afraid my courtiers would have nightmares, to put it politely. Would they accept an ugly commoner cooking their food?;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5015.desc;Bat bones are said to bring a lot of luck, according to Cretan folklore. I don’t know whether having some by my side would bring me any fortune, but it should at least leave a good impression on my Cretan subjects. I’ll go look for some!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5015.a;Not to mention it’s a good excuse to get some fresh air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.tooltip;I’ll ask the locals where’s the best place to get fresh bat bones.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.title;Finding Bat Bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.desc;Cretan folklore says that to kill a bat is a terrible thing and will cause much bad luck, and thus one has to be careful when looking for bat bones inside caves - you don’t want to end up killing one of the bats still alive!\n\nUp ahead, I see the cave I wish to enter. Locals have told me this cave contains a lot of bats.\n\nLooks like there’s no turning back now, huh?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.a;In I go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5016.b;I’m... starting to have second thoughts... the cave looks scary and dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5017.title;Cowardice Pays!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5017.desc;As I walk home, thinking about how people would react if they knew I was this cowardly, I feel something under my feet. Crouching down on the ground, I sift through the dirt a bit. To my amazement, I find some bat bones!;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5018.desc;I make my way through the cave, torch in hand, and eventually find some bat bones. Thank goodness!\n\nAs I dig deeper, I find other things as well - tiny bits of what must have been marble and stone blocks, some metal pots and scraps, and even a few pottery shards decorated with paintings of bulls. Maybe there was once an underground temple to a pagan bull god of sorts, once.\n\nAs I collect some bat bones and I continue digging, and come across something strange. ”These aren’t bat bones...” I mutter. “Aren’t those... bite marks... on human skeletons?!?!?”\n\nSuddenly, I hear some heavy breathing nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5018.a;Damn it, the fire on my torch just went out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5019.tooltip;Are those... red eyes... staring at me?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5019.title;Man? Or Bull?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Who are you?” I shout. “Show yourself!” I absentmindedly raise the bat bones in front of me, thinking it’s my torch.\n\nI hear a most unearthly, horrifying sound coming from the bull - I think it is a bull now, is it? The creature, or person, or whatever it is walks away, into the darkness, leaving me alone once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5019.a;Did the... did the bat bones do something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5020.desc;I am temporarily blinded by the sunlight as I make my way out the cave.

All I know is that these bat bones are indeed lucky. They protected me and scared way that beast!\n\nSighing, I make my way back home, clutching tightly on the bat bones.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5020.a;Perhaps I encountered a bull-like monster? Quite an encounter then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5020.b;It was probably just a bear, and my imagination overexaggerated things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5022.tooltip;This handwriting is atrocious.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5022.title;Just Like Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5022.desc;You read through several more scrolls, learning more about the ancients - in a way, they weren’t so different than you.

Again and again I send you a letter, but I do not receive a single letter from you, and I have become without hope towards you. My misfortune is that I have been in Dunhuang for three years thanks to you, and there was a way out a first, a second, even a fifth time, but he refused to bring me out.”\n\nThe rest of the letter is unreadable.;;;;;;;;;;;x

When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, careful inquiry is to be made, and a decision is to be made according to law. If it is otherwise, or you are not clear there, these disputants are to be taken into custody and sent here to the king's court, where there will be a decision.”;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5028.desc;The holy men always suggest I unite with my sister in a holy union. Ha! Never! Sure, she isn’t a bad person, but there are better choices out there. She is annoying at times, too.

VIETmisc.5028.a;This is getting annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5029.tooltip;Sorry, my sister, but no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5030.title;A Strange Contest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5030.desc;[From.GetFirstName] has been bothering me with that stupid favor again. At wit’s end, I think of a way to get rid of her. I rummage through my possessions, trying to see if there’s anything of use. Threatening her with a sword might be too drastic, for instance, and I don’t think bribing her with gold would work either. Then, I see something and come up with an idea.\n\nLater, when she approaches me again with the same request, I smile deviously, telling her that I will do the favor she asks… if, that is, she plays a “game” of my choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5030.a;“Sure,” she says, “What could go wrong?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5031.tooltip;Heh heh… just you wait, silly sister of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5032.desc;I return with a toothbrush, and tell [From.GetFirstName] what game we’ll be playing: “I will brush your teeth, for, say, five minutes. If you can bear with it, then I’ll do as you wish.”\n\nWhen my sister looks at me incredulously, bewildered at why I would do this, I explain. “It is uncomfortable when someone touches your hair, no? Or when someone tickles you for that matter, right? Then if someone were to brush your teeth, it’d be extremely uncomfortable. Endure this discomfort for five minutes, and you win.”\n\nMy sister understands, and laughs. She’s confident she can win such a silly game.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5032.a;How naive. Let’s begin, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5033.tooltip;The two of you sit down, and you ready the toothbrush. “Say aaah,” you tell her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5034.title;Uncomfortable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5034.desc;Without further ado, I lower the toothbrush, and begin brushing [From.GetFirstName]’s teeth. She whimpers a bit, feeling uncomfortable, but manages to stay composed. I can only continue grinning, knowing the worst is yet to come. Thin hairs are stimulating the most delicate, interior parts of her body, so it will feel good - too good, in fact! "If you give up now, sister dear, you'll feel good. Or, rather, you'll stop feeling good!"\n\nShe moans.\n\nI gulp. That moan sounded very strange. And as she trembles under the discomfort - and pleasure - of the sensations, I, too, begin to feel strange.;;;;;;;;;;;x

My heart begins to beat wildly, and my face grows hot. This is a bad, this is bad!\n\nMy head grows dizzy, as I feel a strange passion overwhelm me. And I see it in her eyes, too.\n\nI edge closer and closer to her, still brushing her teeth, and gaze deeply into her eyes. “[From.GetFirstName]...” I murmur, unable to resist any longer, as my free hand moves closer and closer to her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5036.a;“It’s alright, brother,” she whimpers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5038.desc;“What are you two doing?”\n\nThe two of us jerk away from each other as one of my servants interrupts. Apparently he was passing by the room, and noticed the commotion. The servant looks bewildered at first. “What are you doing, master, pushing your sister down while she is smiling? And what are you doing, mistress, having a smile on your face while your brother pushes you down?”\n\n“What a coincidence! What were we doing?” [From.GetFirstName] and I exclaim in unison, feigning ignorance and confusion.\n\nThe servant says, “I absolutely understand! I won’t say a thing!”;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.5040.desc;After a long awkward silence, eventually, I speak. “Um… well, [From.GetFirstName], it looks like you’ve won. That was certainly longer than five minutes. I’ll do that favor you want.”\n\n”Still,” she says, with a thoughtful look on her face, “That seems kind of unfair to you. Maybe we can make it best two out of three? I can brush your teeth this time.”\n\nI consider that for a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5040.a;“Sure,” I reply, “Why not.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5041.tooltip;My sister and I watch each other warily for a moment, and then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5042.title;Fraternal Love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5042.desc;And so, after that day, [From.GetFirstName] and I began to get along a little better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5042.a;To be honest, I don’t remember who won the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5043.desc;You worry about a lot of things pertaining to your realm's safety and prosperity. There are so many problems to be solved, so many challenges to be tackled. Even today, as you attempt to take a stroll to get a breath of fresh air, you can not stop thinking about things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5043.a;Hmm.... How can I deal with...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.tooltip;You continue thinking long and hard as you continue walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.title;Lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.desc;Suddenly, you look around, and your surroundings are unfamiliar. Lost! You got lost! It appears you were so deep in thought you wandered off the road.\n\n"Not good," you think to yourself, as you try to find your way. "Now what? Not only am I lost, I have serious problems in my realm to deal with. How will my vassals and courtiers deal with them if I'm not around? In particular, I am most worried about...";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.a;My relations with other lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.b;The military threats we face;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.c;How well our realm's economy is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5044.d;Various plots that threaten me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5045.tooltip;So many things to think about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5045.title;Hospitality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5045.desc;As you continue worrying about your problems, the sun begins to set. Thankfully, you stumble on a modest cottage. A middle-aged peasant woman opens the door after you knock on it several times. As you are wearing rather humble clothing, she mistakes you for a well-to-do merchant or traveler, rather than a noble lord. Still, because you are so deep in thought, and because she appears to be a trustworthy, good-natured sort, you don't bother to correct her misunderstanding.\n\nThe peasant graciously welcomes you inside. "Make yourself at home, traveler," she says, "I am but a humble peasant. You've come just in time, too! I'm baking bread right now, and I will share it with you if you're hungry.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5045.a;Thank you, m'am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5046.tooltip;You take a seat across from the small oven in the hut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5046.title;A Simple Task;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5046.desc;Now in a safer location, you begin thinking about your problems again. However, you are interrupted by the peasant. "Sorry, dear guest, but it appears I've to take care of something. My stupid husband, leaving me to fix this - when he left this morning to go to the nearby town he accidentally... never mind, it probably doesn't matter to you. Anyways, would you mind watching the bread while I leave the house for a while? Just remove it from the oven if it looks like it's done."\n\n"Don't worry, m'am," you tell her, "It's the least I can do for your kindness and hospitality.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5046.a;The peasant woman leaves the hut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bready_thinking;And all is silent, save for the crackling of the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5047.title;Time to Think;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5047.desc;Alone by yourself, once more, you begin to contemplate the relations you have with the other realms around you. Envoys, dignitaries, merchants, and travelers visit you frequently to inform you on these matters. But there's one particular issue that's been bothering you. You're not sure how to solve it diplomatically without creating -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5047.a;Wait a moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5048.desc;Alone by yourself, once more, you begin to contemplate the military problems you face. Your warriors are brave, sure, but there are also certain weaknesses in your army you wish to address. Indeed there's one particular issue that's been bothering you. Your military, that is, may have trouble with regards to organizing -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5049.desc;Alone by yourself, once more, you begin to contemplate your realm's economy. So it seems that things are going well enough - trade flows through like ever, the peasants have enough to eat, and so on. However, there's one particular issue that's been bothering you. Your advisors and officers have warned you about possible trouble in the future when it comes to -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5050.desc;Alone by yourself, once more, you begin to contemplate the intrigue of your court. It's not that you don't know you have enemies, friends, and family, all scheming against you and each other. Still, there's one particular issue that's been bothering you. The problem is that you're unsure whether this plot you've heard about is actually -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5047.tooltip;What's that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5051.title;Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5051.desc;"What did you do? I go away for a few minutes, and this happens!"\n\nYou apparently did not notice the peasant woman return, and now she is standing above you, fuming and red-faced. It takes you a while before you notice a strange smell... a burnt smell. In fact, you were too engrossed in your thoughts that you forgot to keep track of the bread.\n\n"I entrust you with one thing, and you ruin it!" she scolds as she takes the burnt bread off the oven. It's scary how calm her movements are, despite the anger in her voice. "You men are useless. Bah, my husband's the worse, but that’s not saying much! Now when you promise someone you'll do something, you better damn do it, I don't know why you - ";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5051.a;She continues ranting on for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5052.tooltip;For a very long while, in fact. Actually you’ve never seen a woman nag this long. If it weren’t for the guilt you feel, you’d have felt very sorry for her brave husband.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5052.title;Small Mistakes, Big Mistakes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5052.desc;Eventually, the peasant woman calms down and apologizes for her outburst, though she still berates you for failing to watch the bread. Even when you meekly tell her you were contemplating important business, she retorts, "If you can't deal with a simple task like watching this bread, how can you deal with whatever ‘important’ business you have? You're just like my husband."\n\nApologizing for your mistake, you help her the best you can with any other chores she has. As night falls, the two of you eat a simple, humble meal. Afterwards, you sleep on the floor of her cottage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5052.a;Surprisingly, you slept better than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5053.tooltip;Maybe it's because you weren't as stressed about the problems of your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5053.title;New Perspectives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5053.desc;The next morning, after bidding the peasant woman farewell, you come back home. Everybody was afraid that something had happened to you, but thankfully it was nothing of that sort.\n\nWishing to thank the peasant woman for her kindness, as well as her wisdom, you decide to send a messenger to her residence, along with some small gifts as a sign of your gratitude. In fact, you were even glad you went through your experience, simple and mundane as it was, for you learned a very important lesson. Not only that, but being able to clear your mind helped you figure out new ways to tackle the problem you were contemplating in the first place!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5053.a;A lesson well learnt! I will never burn my bread ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5054.desc;A beautiful wench throws herself at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5054.a;Alright, yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5054.b;I’m not sure… but… for some reason… I feel compelled…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5054.c;I will not be tempted! I will not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5054.d;I sense something wrong here… no, I must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5055.tooltip;The girl smiles, her hips swaying as she approaches you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5055.title;Dream Come True!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5055.desc;The girl squeals in ecstasy as the two of you engage in passionate lovemaking. Why, you’ve never experienced anything so erotic and pleasurable! This girl is a demon in bed - she can perform the most bewitchingly vulgar acts, partake in the most delightfully lewd positions, engage in the most satisfyingly obscene activities. Somehow, you don’t know why, but you seem to have even more stamina than usual - you’re going at it at a rate you never expected! Perhaps it has something to do with her desirable curves, her oozing sensuality… something like that. Surely you want to keep this girl, she’s too good, way too good, inhumanly good at this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5055.a;I have to be dreaming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5056.tooltip;The two of you continue with your non-stop lovemaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5056.title;Enchantment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5056.desc;The two of you are still at it. She is now on top of you, smiling. Smiling back, you gaze upwards - or, at least, you think you’re gazing upwards. You’re not really sure what you’re even looking at, at this rate, the pleasure is so great you barely sense anything else.\n\nBut you do at least try to gaze on her lovely face. Lovely, it is, yes, all of her - the alluring bosom and thighs, the slender feminine form, a face like the moon, long seductive hair, red eyes that flutter like no other, pearly white teeth like wolves’ fangs, the smooth pointed horns growing out of -\n\nWait a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5056.a;Red eyes? Fangs? Pointed horns out of her -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5057.tooltip;AAAAAGGGGGHHHHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5057.title;True Colors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5057.desc;You try to shout for help - but for some reason, words can’t escape your mouth! Unable to speak, you desperately try to wiggle out, jump off, roll over, do anything to get away, to no avail. This… this thing, whatever she is, she must have paralyzed you somehow.\n\nIn fact, the two of you are technically still connected, still in the middle of lovemaking, but you don’t care. Your eyes grow in terror as you begin to see her eyes grow redder, her teeth enlarge into fangs, and the protruding horns on her head. It’s then that you realize, this was no pretty wench, this was a demon of some sort!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5057.a;NO! NOOO!!! NOOOOOO!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5058.tooltip;What have I gotten myself into?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5058.title;Dream or Nightmare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5058.desc;Smiling wickedly, the demoness opens her mouth and begins to lower her face. You again try to scream, to no avail - nothing comes out of your mouth. Your senses begin to fail you as you feel her bite on your shoulder.\n\nIn your last moment, you reflect on how foolish you were, how seduced you were by the mere hips and bosom of a woman. If you could chuckle, you would, at how future bards would sing of your downfall, caused by your lust. And how comic the scene is, in a way, as you lay dying and this demoness sucking away your life force, that the tempting form of her body - which, of course, you no longer find tempting - is atop of you, the two of you connected in flesh and blood like two copulating animals.\n\nA pathetic end.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5058.a;I only hope there is a comfortable place for me in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5058.b;I will die with pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_succubus_piety;In your head, you say some prayers, hoping you will be taken care of in the afterlife. And so, your death begins - one journey ends, and another begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_succubus_prestige;Though you can’t exactly move, you try thrusting yourself at her lascivious body, savoring the last sensations of pleasure you will ever feel. You will die enjoying yourself, and no less! Better to die in high spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5059.title;Awake;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5059.desc;You open your eyes.\n\nYou can move again! You even blubber some words! Alive, alive! It seems like it was just a bad nightmare! Or… was it? After the initial euphoria passes, you sit up in bed, thinking about the experience. Though it was a dream - nay, a nightmare - the fact that you almost died thanks to unrestrained lust is unsettling. What if it had happened in real life? You’ve heard tales of evil demons or spirits tempting good men and women, after all. You must be careful from now on.\n\nYou say a quick prayer to GOD, before going back to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5059.a;You sleep soundly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5060.desc;Everyone says I should always get along with my sister. Ha! Never! Sure, she isn’t a bad person, but our relationship isn't perfect. She is annoying at times. These past few days, for instance, she has been insisting I do a certain favor for her. It’s not an unreasonable favor, I admit, but why does it have to be me?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5060.a;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5061.title;Winter Wind Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5061.desc;As the winter wind begins to come down this year, I am suddenly reminded of someone dear to my heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5061.a;Her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5062.title;My Memories are Still Beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5062.desc;Do I want to remember? As much as it pains me, thinking about her still makes me so happy all the while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5062.a;Back then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5063.title;Despite a Sheet of Frozen Tears;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5063.desc;She was a girl who lived nearby. I think she was of high birth - otherwise how would I have been able to play with her in the first place? - but her family was impoverished and had little influence on local affairs. We played a lot as children, her and me, the both of us. Now, I’m starting to really miss those times.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5063.a;Makes me feel melancholy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5064.title;And I Don’t Remember;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5064.desc;Unfortunately a lot of my memories of that girl are hazy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5064.a;It’s been a while, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5065.title;Why I Shed These Tears;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5065.desc;For instance, I vaguely recall some argument we had. We were young, after all, and did stupid things. I think I said some really nasty things to her. Wait, that’s what happened, right? I don’t exactly recall. Maybe it was something else? Perhaps I offended her somehow and didn’t properly apologize?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5065.a;Whatever it was, I regret doing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5066.title;Now the Winter Winds of Yesteryear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5066.desc;When did we have that argument again? Oh, it must have been sometime during the winter, I think. Argh! Just thinking about it puts me in a bad mood. Sure, sure, I tell myself, I was young, I was young, but come on, no one should say those kinds of things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5066.a;I would apologize now if I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5067.title;Turn Back the Clock for Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5067.desc;Why did we even fight that time? We made up so quickly, as young people are wont to do, but I am rather curious now. What was it that got us into that argument in the first place? This is bothering me quite a bit. Regardless, how I wish I could go back, make sure it never happened! Admittedly, I’m probably thinking about this too much, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5067.a;We did reconcile after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5068.title;A Misunderstanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5068.desc;Hmm. Now that I think it over, our conflict must have started with some sort of misunderstanding. It had to be. We usually got along, that girl and I, and shared things and agreed with each other. Surely there was some sort of misunderstanding - yes, that had to be it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5068.a;And somehow, thanks to that, we got into our argument...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5069.title;A Moment’s Hesitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5069.desc;Maybe she asked me a very sensitive question, and I did not respond immediately, making her think I had a negative response in mind?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5069.a;Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5070.title;Cliched Sentimentalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5070.desc;Or perhaps she wanted some romance - we were just starting to come to that age after all - but I misinterpreted her advances. Would be a bit of a cliche if that were the case, though.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5070.a;Perhaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5071.title;The Perfect Moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5071.desc;What was it? I at least recall that she asked me something, yes, that was it, that’s what started this all. But I don’t quite remember what. Not yet, at least. She did seem nervous, right, didn’t she? Maybe she had waited a long time to answer this - to clear up some sort of misunderstanding, to confirm something.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5071.a;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5072.title;Lost Forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5072.desc;But anyways, I still miss that girl. We were such good friends… could our relationship have deepened into something more beautiful?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5072.a;I’ll never know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5073.title;Once More, Never Again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5073.desc;If we met again, I’d make sure we wouldn’t get into those sort of arguments, ever again. It’d just be like the good days, when we’d mess around and enjoy ourselves, when we did not have to worry about adult responsibilities. No more stupid arguments. No more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5073.a;I do miss her, don’t I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5074.title;I Remain Young and Trusting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5074.desc;Though, now that I think about it, thinking that you will never get into stupid arguments is kind of naive. Only children think that everybody can simply get along with each other. The world just doesn’t work like that. Yet, to be honest, I wanted - and want - that sort of relationship with that girl. A pure companionship. A pure love.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5074.a;I suppose I’m still childish in a way, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5075.title;With My Unspoken Love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5075.desc;So I did love her after all, I’ve realized. I wanted to be with her forever - silly, isn’t it? I thought she was the most wonderful person ever.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5075.a;Yet I never told her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5076.title;And Numb Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5076.desc;Oh, wait now…. Now I remember what she asked me. I can’t believe it. It’s so cliched. I should have remembered after all these years. She said it so randomly, so suddenly that day:;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5076.a;“Hey, [Root.GetFirstName], do you love me?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5077.title;Once More, Never Again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5077.desc;I didn’t answer her at the time. But if she were here now, and asked me that question again, what would I tell her? Would I answer “yes”?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5077.a;Surely I would, considering how much I miss her now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5078.title;I Never Gave an Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5078.desc;And so I finally recall now why she was so angry. I didn’t give her any sort of proper response that day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5078.a;That must have hurt her deeply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5079.title;Which Pains Me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5079.desc;Frankly, it hurts me too, that I never gave her a proper answer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5079.a;And I will never be able to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5080.title;But I Remain Beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5080.desc;I wonder if she were here, now, I would still love her. But that said, I hope - and I only hope - that she would still think of me highly on the other hand. I haven’t done many great things in life, but, then, nobody’s perfect. She always encouraged me to do my best. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5080.a;I hope she is proud of me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5081.title;And Leave Behind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5081.desc;But she is no longer here. Even though we made up after the incident, of course, we soon parted afterwards - parted forever. It was inevitable, I suppose. We were young, we did not realize that our childhood would not last forever.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5081.a;Nothing lasts forever. Nothing bad, nothing good. Nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5082.title;The Warmth of Your Skin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5082.desc;But to this day, I still think of that silly girl. I still think of those times we sat under that tree, side by side, our shoulders touching as we smiled and laughed and talked about nothing. I still think of that stupid, silly way she smiled. My friend. My companion. My inspiration. My angel.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.5082.a;My first love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5083.title;The Toymakers of [VIET_toymaker_province.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5083.desc;[VIET_toymaker_province.GetName] part of your realm has always been impoverished. Unable to develop their economy well, many of the villages in the area turned to the toymaking industry as a last resort decades ago. Surprisingly, this decision turned out to be rather profitable - now the toys of [VIET_toymaker_province.GetName] are renowned as being of high quality and beautiful craftsmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5083.a;Interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5083.b;I must buy some of these toys for my children!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#VIETmisc.5084.a;Anything for you, my child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5084.b;I will only buy you a few toys and you must share them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5084.c;No. Toys will spoil you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#VIETmisc.5085.desc;While the toymaking industry of [VIET_toymaker_province.GetName] has generally done well, it has fallen on hard times recently. Though the local toymakers believe their industry will survive, they feel if you supported them financially, it’d make things a lot easier for them and it might even give the local economy a boost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.5085.a;Very well, let us set aside funds to assist them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#VIETmisc.5086.a;That is a kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
