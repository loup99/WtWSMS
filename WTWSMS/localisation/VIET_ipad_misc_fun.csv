VIETmisc.2016.desc;A new cosmetic popular among the noblewomen is made using the egg yolk of from quail eggs instead of the usual chicken eggs. But quail eggs are a rare luxury much more suited for gourmet food. Are these women truly vain?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.a;A useless product!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.b;I could've eaten those eggs... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.c;This does not concern me. The fad will pass in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.d;I think it looks nice on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2017.desc;Yesterday was a local traditional festival held annually in the city. During the night, while I was away celebrating, some drunk and inconsiderate revelers dared to egg the front of my house! Now I have to pay to clean it up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2017.a;Maybe those hooligans were sent by my business rivals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2018.desc;Yesterday I went to the local tavern and had too much beer. While drunk I ordered a large amount of pickled eggs to eat with my beer, as I usually do. However, this time, in my drunkeness I must have taken and paid for all the pickled eggs the tavern had. Now do I not only have to deal with my hangover, I have to figure out what to do with these eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2018.a;Looks like we'll be eating pickled eggs for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.desc;Today you visited one of your vassals. While there, both of you dined on a delicious sponge cake... or, at least, it was delicious until both of you nearly choked on eggshells. Now my vassal is highly embarrassed by his cook's incompetency at cooking with eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.a;And he should be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.b;It's no matter, things happen all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.desc;For dinner tonight I'll be having deviled eggs. What should be stuffed in these eggs, I wonder? My cook will make them taste good regardless of what's inside them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.a;Vegetables. Who says abstaining from excess isn't delicious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.b;Meat. I want something to strengthen me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.c;Milk, cream, or cheese. It shall taste richer and fatten me well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.desc;The unbeliever is brought before you to be sentenced. He refuses to repent and change from his erroneous ways. Ha! It is amazing there are people who do not believe in the Dulcinian faith. He is corrupted - but can he still be purified and without being executed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.a;Death is the only way this wretch can be purified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.b;Spare him. Didn't Jesus teach us to be merciful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.c;The Catholics would hunt and kill us. Let us not be hypocrites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.desc;The Dulcinian faith teaches me that it is acceptable to plunder and kill "good" Christians who support a corrupt hierarchy of clergy or go against us, for we are pure in our belief. Can we truly be pure if we kill our enemies, even if they are corrupt?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.a;Of course! God's creation must be purified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.b;I am starting to have my doubts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.desc;This commoner has nerve! He says your vassal should give him and their other neighbors money. We are good Dulcinians, after all, he argues, who live in an equal society - why does this noble then hoard money and luxuries and refuse to share it with others? However, your vassal refuses to give anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.a;Be a good Dulcnian my vassal, share the wealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.b;Ideals are good, but in the real world we can't always abide by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.desc;Do you remember that worthless knight, the one who was found guilty of irredeemably corrupt according to Dulcinian doctrine? He was just purified yesterday - that is, his soul redeemed (that is, he was executed most effectively). Now you have all his precious belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.a;Stuff for free! Ah, it's great when people are... "purified".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.b;Let's share the knight's things with the needy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.desc;Peasants in one of your provinces accused a minor noble of being corrupt, betraying the Dulcinian doctrine of equality and charity. Wishing to "purify" him, they lynched him, torched his house, and killed his entire family, including his innocent young newborn child!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.a;These damn peasants! They take our faith too seriously!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.b;If a baby were corrupted, I'd "purify" that worthless piece of trash too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.desc;I've been drinking out late at night with two of your favorite servants. As I walk home, the three of you spot an old man on a rickety old cart. My servants, still intoxicated, throw stones at the cart, breaking one of the axles. They laugh and tell me to join in, but feel something's not right. What's an old man like that doing in the middle of the night?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.a;I'll help the old man fix his cart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.b;Run away! Who knows what that old bloke is up to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.c;Ignore the man and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2027.tooltip;You help the mysterious old man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2027.desc;This morning my two favorite servants were found dead of natural causes (apparently, you were told). What more, a large patch of my hair somehow turned white. I just know it had to do something with that mysterious old man I met yesterday.... Wait, heaven protect me! I know who that old man was, it was Ankou, the henchman of death!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2027.a;No one must know of what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
met_ankou;Met Ankou;;;;;;;;;;;x
met_ankou_desc;There are rumors that this character met the Breton henchman of death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2028.desc;As I am drinking chouchen - Breton cider mixed with honey - with my courtiers, one of them suggests adding some bee venom into it to increase it's intoxicating effects. "I've tried it before, in one of the smaller villages," the courtier claims. "It is an extraordinary experience!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2028.a;Are you insane? This is strong enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2028.b;Yes, I like the sound of that. Let's find some bee venom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.desc;We have some guests from afar coming tonight, and I wish to serve them some of the finest Breton crepes. Should we serve them sweet or savory?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.a;Sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.b;Savory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.c;"Why not both?" your child says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yay_mexican_girl;Your courtiers cheer and lift the girl up in jubilation at her brilliant idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2030.desc;I live near the sea, and thus my ears constantly suffer from the loud shouts of the traditional hues - cliff top lookouts who help fishermen. They constantly shout "hevva, hevva!" to alert the fishermen as to where the fish are. We Cornish love our fish, but all this shouting is driving me crazy!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2030.a;Gah! I can't do much. We need the fishermen if we want fish, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2031.desc;I am about to sail on a short voyage to one of the local seaside towns for some official business. I bring with me some good old Cornish pasties (those delicious succulent meats in pastry dough!) on board the ship, but one of the sailors pleads me not to. "It's bad luck to bring pasties on board! Throw it off deck, that the dead mariners be at peace, my liege!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2031.a;Ha ha, no way. I like these delicious pasties too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2031.b;Very well, very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_believed_superstition;Believed superstition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_ignored_superstition;Ignored superstition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2032.desc;While visiting one of the local monasteries, I come across the monastery kitchen. There the monks have stocked a lot of rather bland foods - most likely to ensure their temperate lifestyle stays temperate. One of the monks tells me, "We have too much clotted cream, my liege. Perhaps we can gift you some for use in your feasts.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2032.a;Clotted cream? Something all Cornish appreciate! I’ll take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2032.b;Give it to the poor and needy instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2033.desc;A Rowan tree of great magical powers has been discovered in one of the provinces I rule. Experts on the local lore says that the tree appears to have a certain special appearance and properties. For as long as it stands, it will protect the surrounding region.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2033.a;A sign of good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_rowan_tree;Magical Rowan Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_rowan_tree_desc;The local Britons believe that a Rowan tree in this province is full of magical properties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2034.desc;A small hill-fort was recently discovered near your residence. Old indeed, it appears to have been a fortification built by your Briton ancestors to protect themselves in the turmoil following the fall of the Roman Empire centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2034.a;What a dark yet heroic age it must have been, the age of Arthur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inspired_by_heritage;Inspired by Heritage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.desc;To be honest, as much as I admire King Arthur (for he is a hero to us Britons), I have to admit the basis of his authority as a powerful feudal lord - the lady of the lake giving him Excalibur - is a bit weak. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for the feudal contract, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.a;But it is his deeds that matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.b;He was given the right to rule by the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.c;Who expects to wield power because a watery tart threw a sword at them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#REFERENCES;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.desc;Being a [Root.GetTitle] is dangerous as I have many enemies who want to kill me. Sometimes this makes me worry a lot. Today I even admitted to my beloved [Lover.GetName] that sometimes I fear [Lover.GetSheHe] is plotting my murder. Upon hearing this, [Lover.GetSheHe] responded, "Of course I want to be the one to kill you. If I kill you, I'll be the one closest to your deathbed.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.a;You're so sweet and romantic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.b;I don't want that kind of twisted love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.c;Ha ha, you always cheer me up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.d;You really are trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.desc;One of your courtiers is ridiculously lazy despite having the sort of talent men would envy. I keep trying to push this courtier to do something, to contribute to the world, to no avail. When I asked the reason for all this laziness, I got this reply: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick. Look, I'm not lazy. I'm just conserving my energy.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.a;Conserving energy to do what? Sleep all day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.b;Heh. I like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.desc;I have in my court a brilliant woman. Yet, when she is asked why and how she knows everything (so it seems), she always meekly replies, "I don't know everything. I just know what I know.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.a;Bah, she's trying to pretend she's so "humble.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.b;I respect such an attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.c;She accepts her position as a member of the docile gender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.desc;People say I am mad? Ha! I am the most powerful ruler alive. I am the great [Root.GetTitle], who can command the greatest armies on earth, who can make love to any and all living things! Today, I will do something satisfying, something worthy of my greatness. Why, I'll eat something... I'll take something stupendous and eat it. Yes, that's it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.a;I'll take my sister... AND EAT HER.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.b;I'll take this Incan potato... AND EAT IT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dn_lunatic_a;Maybe I can brush her teeth too... [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows what I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_b;I love these occidental vegetables, especially when they're cut thinly and fried!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_c;Anyone who doesn't like baklava... WILL DIE! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_d;First though I need to find some falafel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_e;I will protect my Jewish subjects, for I love their music! It speaks to the soul...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_f;People question why I think all Italians are ugly? It's they who are mad, not me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_g;That should make the peasants shut up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_h;Nobody steals my sweetrolls! NOBODYYYYYYYY!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_i;And consequently become divine! Immortal! Invincible! BWAHOHOHOHOHOHO...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_j;It is better to be feared than loved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.desc;Your face is buried in your hands as you sit on your chair. You feel like you almost want to cry, or scream, or something. Life, it is so difficult! Your plans, always gone astray. Your hopes, always dashed. Your dreams, always destroyed. I'm in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.a;Having no sister to "comfort me" has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.b;My realm's troubles has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2505.desc;"Nice boat," my lover comments, as we are inspecting one of my family's ships leaving port on a business trip.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2505.a;Why, thank you, that's so kind of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2505.b;Are you... YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2506.desc;I am sitting there quietly, eating my meal when someone joins me. Someone who is, to be specific, either unhinged or simply annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2506.a;"Hello there, my courtier," I say, trying to be polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2507.tooltip;Oh heaven save me, they have that atrociously stupid and hideous smile on their face again...;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_yes_angry;I WILL STAY CALM. I WILL STAY CALM. I WLSTAY CALM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2509.desc;A moment later, thanks to your well-timed punch, [From.GetFirstName] lies on the floor, half-conscious, muttering something about yellow flying cats.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2509.a;Goodness gracious, I'm glad I don't have to deal with that madman everyday...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2510.desc;It is early in the morning, and I am awoken to a loud sound. I look upwards, and gaze at my bedroom door. There stands my daughter, holding a glistening, shiny knife, with the most horrific smile on her face. She says cheerfully, "You woke up yourself. That's too bad.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2510.a;What are you doing... with that knife -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.desc;"I was checking to see if you were awake yet," my daughter says just as I am about to make a run for it. "I'm helping the cook make some meat for breakfast, daddy, and we wanted to surprise you! Oh well. What meat would you like to eat later?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.a;IN THE NAME OF [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.b;Oh! Hmm... I'll take chicken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.c;You will not be cooking. It is improper for someone of your status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.d;Cook whatever, I don't care, let me go back to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.desc;We are all good Dulcinians, engaging in prayer to assure God of our purify and faith, when my courtier bursts in, saying, "Penitenziagite! Watch out for the draco who cometh in futurum to gnaw your anima! La morte e supremos. You contemplatum the apocalypsum. La-bas, nous avons il diabolo, ugly comme Salvatore;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2512.b;Do not interrupt us. Unless you want to be... purified?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.c;You really are as ugly as you claim to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Cretan Fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.desc;Peasants nearby discovered a buried bull-shaped vase in the Cretan countryside. It doesn't appear to be of any contemporary style, and perhaps dates to ancient times. Discussing the matter with some local scholars, it seems that the Cretan pagans worshipped bulls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.a;It would make a nice decoration in my bedroom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.b;Perhaps I could sell it, given it is in good condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.c;Discard this pagan, heathen contraption! It is evil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.d;I notice many bull-shaped objects lying around Crete... I should study them more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.desc;As you sip on your Cretan wine and take a bite into the delicious Kalitsounia pie with herbs and sweet cheese, the musician approaches, holding the traditional Cretan lyra in his hands. "O [Root.GetTitledFirstName], for my next improvisation, shall I sing of love, or shall I sing of death?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.a;Sing of love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.b;Sing of death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.c;These Cretan cheese pies are DELICIOUS - wait, you said something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.desc;Another vendetta has broken out among two prominent Cretan families under your rule. These families aren't too powerful, relatively speaking, but they are powerful and influential enough that their activities are causing a lot of havoc in the area. This isn’t the first time you’ve heard of problems like this on Crete...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.a;Gah! These simpleton villagers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.b;Put an end to this feud. Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.desc;On the mountainsides and gorges of Crete are plenty of plants called "Cretan Dittanies." I've been told by many Cretans that there is no better way to prove one's love than traversing the difficult terrain to collect these plants when they bloom with lovely pink flowers - not to mention there are rumors they are an excellent aphrodisiac!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.a;Why would I risk my life for these stupid plants?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.b;I'll get some for my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.c;I'll get some for my spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9000.desc;Crete has produced quality wines since time immemorial, and it is an important part of local culture and tradition - festivals are constantly held throughout the year in different parts of the island to celebrate grapes and good drink. This year, you’ve found some time to attend one of these festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9000.a;Fun awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.tooltip;You prepare to attend one of the local Cretan wine festivals and set off for the village where a festival will soon be held.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.title;The Wines of Crete;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.desc;The wine festival is just as exciting as you expected. As you arrive at the village, you see hundreds of people - commoner and noble alike - gather to take part. There’s much to do, be it drinking delicious wines, participating in the many traditional Cretan dances, or enjoying the good food! You can’t believe you don’t come to these celebrations more often.\n\nFriends, guests, even passersby lifting their glasses to toast, and wishing well to each other. Instruments start play. Hearts warm up. Arms open. Spirits are high! Big Cretan men lead the dance, while women and men alike sing traditional songs. People exchange smiles, banters, good feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.a;This is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cretan_festival_next;The festival is well under way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.tooltip;Drinking wine is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.desc;No wonder Crete is famous for its wines! They are many and of great quality. You’re sampling the various different wines available, including the notoriously strong “raki” or “tsikoudia.” As you continue sipping on the fine wine, a few of the local men - burly, big fellows with the infamous Cretan mustaches - invite you to join them in the drinking contests!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.a;No thanks, I've drunk enough for now. Maybe later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.b;Haha! I’ll beat these amateurs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.tooltip;I have to remember when I can and can’t dance, though, the Cretan locals can be quite fussy about the rules of dancing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.desc;Cretans sure love to dance! The locals have so many dances, it’s hard to keep track of which is which - trizalis, tsiniaris, kanelia, ntames, pidikhtos, and the energetic war dance, the pentozali, which is full of high jumping. Men and women alike are running and jumping and twirling and twisting with unrestrained liveliness.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.a;Maybe I should join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.tooltip;So much good food, so much good food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.desc;There is so many types of Cretan food. Simple peasant meals, perhaps, but they’re delicious! Kalitsounia sweet cheese pies, traditional Dacos bread, Cretan sausages and cheeses, pomegranates, chestnuts...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.a;One would think I’m at a food festival, not a wine festival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9005.desc;Unfortunately, all good things have to come to an end. The wine festival concludes, and you must return home. It will be a while before you’ll find time in your schedule to visit one of these local celebrations, but perhaps it wouldn’t be a bad idea to come back in the future. After all, it’s rare for you to experience that much excitement and merriment in such a sort time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9005.a;Now back to my dull old life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9006.desc;As you ride upon your horse, into the horizon, you gaze one last time at the village you just visited for the wine festival. A few of the villagers are still milling about, perhaps with hangovers. Absentmindedly, you shout goodbye to the them. To your surprise, they cheerfully shout farewell back at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9006.a;Haha! I’ll miss you all! It was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.desc;Crete's prosperity is undeniable! Muslims from the Levant and North Africa keep coming in order to seek their fortune from Crete's commercial opportunities. Today, one such man came to my court, seeking to serve me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.a;Very well, we will allow him to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2514.b;Ooook, I've heard enough. Out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2515.desc;Without thinking twice you run outside with the old man to begin your quest. When you reach the courtyard he draws a piece of chalk and uses it to draw a game of hopscotch on the floor. 'Avatar! Before you lies a test of dexterity!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2518.desc;Your guide is in the middle of telling you for the 9th time just how important your quest is when you two stumble upon a clearing in the forest. Suddenly the old man becomes alarmed and starts pacing back and forth as if looking for something on the ground or in the sky. You become alarmed that you may have been led to a trap as the man start muttering 'There was supposed to be a fortune teller... cards...skills... No! You are not the Avatar! I was wrong!' With this is runs away with unprecedented dexterity, leaving you to wonder what just happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2518.a;What is this I don't even...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2519.desc;It's been a while since you rushed outside ready to go on an adventure because an old men said you are some sort of 'Avatar', but clearly your courtiers haven't forgot and it's still a source of laughter now and then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2519.a;May I remind you who rules this realm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2519.b;A mere mortal can dream, can't he...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2520.desc;'Remove the saxon remove the saxon! To our saxon cousins you may come to our country you may live in the farm! (...) Battle of Badon best day of my life, take a bath of death saxon hahahaha (...)' It seems the troupe of jesters performing to yuor court decided to try a rauchy song... Your briton courtiers are laughing, but your saxon ones... not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2520.a;What a joyous and catchy tune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2520.b;To the stocks with these jesters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
remove_kebab_insult;A really bad joke;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.desc;Not again! While passing by some Chinese travelers at the local market today, I heard them commenting on the beauty of [Root.Culture.GetName] women. Why are these Chinese so obsessed with our women? Apparently they’ll call even the ugliest [Root.Culture.GetName] girl a “flower unlike any other”! Haha!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.a;The silly Chinese don’t know where to look for real [Root.Culture.GetName] beauties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.b;Admittedly I find the attention flattering…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.c;Admittedly I find the attention creepy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.d;We DO have the most beautiful women in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.e;Beauty in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.f;I find their inability to judge beauty more amusing than infuriating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2041.desc;Today I’ve learned that our great Sogdian language provided the barbarian Turks with many important terms they did not have previously, such as debt.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2041.a;We have many great accomplishments, undoubtedly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2041.b;It’s thanks to us the Turks were able to do anything in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.desc;The old murals that decorate your palace are beginning to deteriorate - they were painted centuries ago, after all. Now is a good time to renovate these murals, perhaps even re-do them with completely new murals. Typically, Sogdian murals tend to focus on either of three things: the divine, heroes, or fables. What shall the new murals focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.a;The divine - gods and spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.b;The heroes - brave men like Rostam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.c;The fables - lessons we all should remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.d;I don’t want to waste money on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2043.desc;While passing by one of the local Sogdian villages, you happen to encounter a woman and her infant child. Feeling generous, you offer her child a bit of rock sugar, a traditional Sogdian gift for newborns and children. The sugar symbolizes the hope that when the child grows up that his words be sweet...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2043.a;We Sogdians shall forever be the best traders and diplomats in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2044.desc;Growing up as a Sogdian child has its disadvantages. Everybody expects you to do well in commerce one day. It’s as if all the adults can think about is money, ways to make money, ways to produce more money, money, money, money, money…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2044.a;Greed is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2045.desc;A lesser nobleman in my realm gave me an hourglass as a gift. It should help me keep track of time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2045.a;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_efficient_time;Efficient Time;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_efficient_time_desc;This character efficiently keeps track of time in order to maximize productivity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2046.desc;Oh no! I overslept and was late to this morning's meeting with my advisors!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2046.a;Why didn't the servants wake me on time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2047.desc;One of my newest personal servants is a diligent fellow, determined even. He always makes sure I do things on time - it pays to have a servant like him!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2047.a;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2048.desc;A big fire broke out in a peasant village uncomfortably close to my residence. Thankfully the local temple had a water clock so large it had enough water to douse the flames.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2048.a;Thank goodness everything’s fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2048.b;We must help those poor peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2049.desc;The sun is high above - it’s noontime, isn’t it? And it is rather hot outside. You’ve been out for a bit too long doing whatever business you were doing, and you’re starting to feel a little light-headed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2049.a;Better retreat inside into the shade, maybe drink some water too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2049.b;I have some business to finish, unfortunately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2050.desc;Oh dear, it seems like I've misplaced one of my rings. Goodness gracious, what am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2050.a;Oh well... hopefully we'll find it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2050.b;Why should I worry about it when there are more important things at stake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2051.desc;One of my courtiers seems to be sad. Why I asked why, I learned that their favorite horse was very ill, and unlikely to survive. I remember this steed was a fine specimen, worthy of honor and praise, who brought its master much prestige and joy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2051.a;Such is life, unfortunately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2051.b;Why should I worry about it when there are more important things at stake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2052.desc;My life is terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2052.a;Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2053.desc;I feel exhausted...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2053.a;So exhausted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2054.desc;I threw up on someone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2054.a;Heehee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2055.tooltip;Uh-oh...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2055.desc;That little brat [From.GetFirstName] threw up on me while we were dining.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2055.a;Ew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2056.desc;Thankfully, I've discovered where I misplaced my ring. It was under my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2056.a;What good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2057.desc;While traveling to a nearby town on official business you come across a corpse on the side of the road. Upon further inspection, it appears to be a beggar who died of who knows what.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2057.a;Ignore the corpse and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2057.b;Inspect it - maybe the beggar has something of use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_beggar_corpse_inspect;“What?” you say as everyone looks at you, bewildered. “Beggars might carry useful things! I read it in a story once!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.desc;As one of your guards approaches the beggar, the old man suddenly jumps up. Everyone shouts in surprise, and your guard nearly cuts down the man by accident. It seems like the beggar was actually just in deep sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.a;Haha, what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.b;Haha, have a coin, beggar, and [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] bless you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.c;Kill that bastard! He dares offend me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2059.desc;The beggar has nothing useful. That's to be expected. Behind you, someone says, “What sort of [Root.GetTitle] goes around searching beggars, anyways?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2059.a;I feel foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_ridiculous_greed;Ridiculous Greed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_ridiculous_greed_desc;The lengths this character would go to satisfy their greed are shocking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2060.desc;The beggar seems to have a precious amulet of some sort - your suspicions were correct! Yet you can’t help but wonder. Why did he keep it, when he could have sold it for money? Did he steal it, and was unable to sell it? Or was it something so precious to him he couldn’t bear to part with it? Or was he just plain stupid?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2060.a;It’s mine now, at any rate. I probably can sell it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2060.b;I don’t feel comfortable looting this beggar’s corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_childlike_wonder;Childlike Wonder;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2061.desc;Why does the sky have different colors when the sun rises and when the sun sets?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2061.a;So mysterious....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2062.desc;What was that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2062.a;Never mind. Must have been my imagination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2063.desc;Bwahahahahahahahahahaha! The suffering of others makes me feel so giddy inside. ;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_sunset_watcher_desc;This character often goes out late in the day to watch the sun set, as it brings them inner peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2064.desc;Now and then, I like to sneak out at dusk and watch the sun as it sets in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2064.a;It's lovely, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2065.desc;Today’s sunset is particularly beautiful. Words can’t describe it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2065.a;I’m loving it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_sexy_times;Did naughty things with me recently;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2066.desc;Making love to my beloved during the sunset was a magical experience. My lover may not understand why sunsets appeal to me, but that’s fine.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2066.a;While the sun may set, something else rises...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2067.desc;I’ve learned that one of my courtiers enjoys watching sunsets, just like me. Yesterday we watched the sunset together, and found that despite our differences, we both shared many things as well.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_navel_gazing;Navel-Gazer;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2068.desc;I feel as if my life was just a part of some bard's pathetic tale, and I'm just a character in it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2068.a;Who would care about my life, anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2069.desc;This itch is really bothersome. I can't stop scratching it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2069.a;I look like a fool in front of my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2070.desc;A tree above me sways gently, its shadow caressing my face. Nearby, I hear the water quietly running down to the fountain below. Birds chirp, and insects buzz. Yes! When I sit in the garden to relax, I feel closer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], and feel his compassion, his mercy, the ingenuity of his designs. It’s as if I can see all of nature before me, from the desert warmth to the ocean breeze.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2070.a;Also, it's a good place to take a nice nap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2071.desc;Something smells funny....\n\nNever mind, the smell went away.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2071.a;Must’ve been my mind playing tricks on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2072.desc;In the middle of a conversation with a courtier, you pause, suddenly. You forgot what you were going to say next.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2072.a;I hate it when that happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2073.desc;Some disgustingly horrific, vile thought just entered my mind. Try as I might, I can’t get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2073.a;If I told my court, they’d think me a lunatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2073.b;Then again, this isn’t the weirdest thing I’ve thought of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2074.desc;For the past few weeks, your court has been short on baklava. Thankfully, a new batch has just arrived from the local baklava merchants! Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2074.a;Now out of my way, fools, I have baklava to eat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2075.desc;There is a large clump of dirt under one of my fingernails.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2075.a;Who cares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2075.b;Better remove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2076.desc;The weather is unusually pleasant today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2076.a;A good day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2077.desc;Eerie, loud noises were heard at night in some of the nearby villages not too long ago. They were sometimes accompanied by strange colors in the sky. Investigation by our officials and soldiers could not determine as to what was the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2077.a;Frightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2078.desc;A strange report from one of your messengers! It appears that every inhabitant of one of the villages in your realm has mysteriously vanished a year ago. Many have searched far and wide, but none were able to where any of these villagers went. Were they murdered? Wandered away? Kidnapped by bandits or otherworldly beings?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2078.a;Seems like supernatural forces at work. Heavens preserve us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2079.desc;While eating, you accidentally put way too much salt on your food, mistaking it for sugar or cheese or something of that sort.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2079.a;This tastes horrible! Too salty, too salty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.desc;While holding court, I notice one of my courtiers is picking their nose.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.a;Disgusting! I should look away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.b;I should draw attention to and embarrass them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.c;Well, I like picking my nose too, so I don't see what's the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2081.desc;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO -\n\nOh, never mind. I thought my baklava disappeared, but it was just behind my goblet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2081.a;I did look like a fool, though, but I have no regrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2082.desc;While having intercourse with my lover, feeling the curves of their body, tickling the places that bring pleasure, and doing other intimate things with them, I notice a strange smell. It's a pleasant smell, but one I don't recognize. Could it... never mind, the smell goes away as quickly as it came.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2082.a;Probably just imagining things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2083.desc;Lately, I've been able to last longer in bed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2083.a;Bring on the fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.desc;I've heard rumors that the Emperors of Cathay are so virile that they have thousands of beautiful young concubines and make love with ten or more of them every night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.a;I wish I had thousands of beautiful women with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.b;I'm content with the relationships I already have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.c;Who would want to live in such a sinful lifestyle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.d;I feel sorry for the Emperor, having to put up with so many women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2085.desc;Last night, I dreamt of making love to the most beautiful person I ever met.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2085.a;I’m still feeling a bit aroused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2086.desc;In your realm, stories have spread of a conman who sells “charms” to unsuspecting children. Some have said that these charms are actually real, others claim they are fake. Some say the fake ones are as effective if not more than real charms, and yet others believe the opposite. Regardless, the conman seems to have mysteriously left for other lands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2086.a;I wonder whether he was a real conman, or a fake one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2087.desc;Three pretty wenches throw themselves at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2087.a;YES!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2087.b;I'm not in the mood for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_foursome_aw_yeah;Three beauties at once? The only thing better than this is...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2088.desc;Unfortunately, it seems three wenches were too much for you, and you exhausted yourself way too quickly. In other words, you were a bit too eager, and embarrassed yourself due to your lack of stamina.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2088.a;Now I’ll be a laughingstock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2088.b;I have no regrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2089.desc;You had a great tumble with those three wenches. Rumors are now spreading about your insatiable lust and great virility.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2089.a;I feel like a real, manly man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2090.desc;While visiting one of the local taverns, you spot a barmaid, unusually attractive for a peasant. You starting making a move on her, but unlike other wenches you’ve come across, she begs for you to leave her alone. She dare refuses you, so mighty and powerful! She should be serving your needs, no?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2090.a;I'll do with her as I wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2090.b;It is wrong to force her like this. I shall leave her alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_barmaid_harassment;You can't wait to satisfy your lust.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2091.desc;As you rip her clothes off, and start having your way with her, you fail to notice a dark figure nearby. Before you or your guards can react, a man - who could be her husband, brother, father, friend, or someone else - jumps on you, screaming for you to leave her alone, and begins stabbing you. Though your guards quickly take care of him, it’s too late.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2091.a;Gugghhhh....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_you_deserved_it_for_harassing_barmaid;Before you pass out, you hear someone mutter, "That's what he gets for trying to mess with a girl like that.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2092.desc;What an amazing dream I had last night! After waking up, I rush over to one of my servants, and begin excitedly telling her about the dream. "You see, last night, I dreamt that I was... um, well, the dream mainly revolved around... uh....";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2092.a;Crap, I forgot what it was about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2093.desc;While out and about, visiting one of the local towns, I saw a most peculiar scene. A young man seemed to be gifting a friend of his a roasted bird, for food, but when his friend took the bird, it sprang to life! It was never dead in the first place. The friend looked terrified, while the young man only laughed at his successful prank.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2093.a;That was funny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2093.b;I should ask him how he did that... I want to try such a prank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2094.desc;I farted so loudly everyone must have heard me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2094.a;Um...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2095.desc;While making love, I farted at a most unfortunate time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2095.a;That killed the mood quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2096.desc;I can't believe it! One of my courtiers absolutely detests one of my favorite stories. Who could even think of criticizing it? Every time I hear a bard sing it I am absolutely spellbound. It has great character development, engaging dialogue, thought provoking themes, and deep symbolism.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2096.a;I admit it can be lewd here and there, but surprisingly this enhances it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2097.desc;If my life was simply a bard’s tale, what kind of story would it be, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2097.a;Romance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2097.c;Epic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2097.d;Allegory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2098.desc;Lately there’s been a fad amongst the younger people, where they tilt their head in strange or awkward positions in order to emphasize things they say in the middle of a discussion. These “head tilts” are supposed to make them look imposing or mysterious. To my surprise, I’m pretty good at it myself and unlike the youths, I can pull it off well without looking like a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2098.a;My neck is very flexible! Now fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2098.b;That said, I don’t want to partake in this stupid fad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2099.desc;I accidentally bit my tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2099.a;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2100.desc;One of my courtiers' has rather bad teeth, even though we have the tools available to maintain acceptable standards of oral hygiene, such as the miswak, the teeth-cleaning twig. I decide to discuss the matter with my courtier one day, and quote a Hadith: "Make a regular practice of Miswak for verily it is the purification for the mouth and a means of the pleasure of the Lord.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2100.a;Your bad breath offends the Prophets and Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2101.desc;In one Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was quoted as saying that "were it not that I might overburdened the Believers I would have ordained them to use Miswak at the time of every prayer." Usage of miswak, the teeth-cleaning twig, is surely a sign of piety! It may be a good idea to vow that I'll use the miswak before every prayer as much as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2101.a;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2101.b;Nay, even the Prophet thinks this is too much a burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2102.desc;A noble visiting from afar has gifted me with a very beautiful toothpick, crafted from the purest gold. It is encrusted with precious stones, and expertly carved into lovely, artistic shapes. Then again, there’s not much a point in wasting this toothpick for cleaning my teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2102.a;It will do as a decoration in my bathroom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2103.desc;Today while talking with a visiting dignitary I learned from him that the men of Cathay prefer toothbrushes with harder, harsher bristles.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2103.a;What a brave people, those Chinese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2103.b;Such stubbornness in their obsession to clean their teeth. Oh my.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.desc;I have such a lewd-minded courtier. Why, today, this fool has the audacity to explain the morally dubious things of a "romantic" nature one could do with a toothbrush! What sickening, horrific, disgusting, disgraceful, shameful, barbaric, animalistic, repulsive, vulgar ideas I am forced to listen to!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.a;Run out of the room before it's too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.b;Listen out of politeness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.c;Why... such ideas aren't half bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.d;Haha, what an amateur. An absolute amateur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_toothbrush_sexy_times_amateurs;If only they knew the sort of things I did with my sister…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2105.desc;One of my older servants told me interesting advice pertaining to oral hygiene that he heard from some learned men. Apparently, it seems that one should clean not only one's teeth, but one's tongue as well. After all, disgusting things accumulate on the tongue as well, so why should we not give it as much focus as we do our teeth?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2105.a;Excellent advice. Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2106.desc;I noticed one of my Jewish courtiers tends to rinse their mouth with a strange concoction every now and then. Questioning them on the matter, I learned that this liquid was a mixture of dough water and olive oil, which the Talmhd advises as a cure for gum ailments.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2106.a;Interesting. I should try it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2106.b;Disgusting Jewish tricks, I will not fall for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2107.desc;Seeing all the older people with their horrid gums and decaying teeth makes me fear about how my mouth could end up like in the future. Therefore, I vow to take every step I can to improve my oral hygiene! I will eat and drink things beneficial to my teeth, for instance, and learn the best techniques for brushing my teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2107.a;Even when I’m old and feeble, I WILL have good teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.desc;I was a little too fixated with cleaning my teeth earlier today, and brushed with too much intensity, resulting in some slight bleeding from my gums. As a result, my teeth are covered in blood. Unfortunately, I have to meet with my court soon, even though I look like a man-eating bloodthirsty monster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.a;Here goes…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.b;Thankfully, I look beautiful no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.c;This will only enhance my fearsome looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2109.desc;“By the way, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I accidentally dropped your toothbrush in the chamber pot,” a courtier known for their pranks tells you. After you halt in shock, the courtier says, “I was just joking. Haha! You should’ve seen your face. Don’t worry, your toothbrush is fine.” Further investigation suggests that your toothbrush is as clean as ever, but still…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2109.a;I feel uneasy. But… alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2110.desc;I'm dreaming of a beautiful place... warm, sunny, peaceful.... And there stands the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She approaches me, in this tropical paradise, and caresses my face like the ocean breeze, pushes onto me like the waves onto the sand...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2110.a;I like this beach very much, in more ways than one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2110.b;Bah! I prefer the cold. Much more romantic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2110.c;This dream is evil! Begone, vile delusions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2111.desc;Now I have to admit one of my courtiers is reasonably well-endowed, in a way that pleases my eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2111.a;Ah, yes, dear, you were saying? I was distracted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2111.b;But such fleeting thoughts are meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2112.desc;That courtier has such lovely arms. So manly. So rugged. So strong.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2112.a;Delicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2112.b;Well, it's not that great. I shouldn’t be distracted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2113.desc;I heard about a very strange sort of... romantic "activity" one of my courtiers is rumored to enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2113.a;It's... really weird. Disturbing, even.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2114.desc;There’s talk of a “forbidden” book in my court. Forbidden in that no one wanted to admit reading it. Naturally, I got curious and started reading it. At first, I didn't see the big deal. That is, until I came to the chapter detailing a particularly creative activity lovers could partake in. The book only got worse from there... or, now that I think about it, perhaps better?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2114.a;I'd like to try all this sometime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2114.b;I cannot forget this even though I want to! NOOOO!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2115.desc;Just the worst timing! Some “thing” is trying to poke out of my pants when it shouldn't be and everyone can see it. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2115.a;I shouldn't have been thinking naughty thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2116.desc;The servant stutters, “Um… my [Root.GetTitle], I can see your…”\n\nYou look down, and to your horror, “it” is exposed. It’s a wardrobe malfunction!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2116.a;The servant mumbles “impressive” or something like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2117.desc;It's unusual cold today and snowing. While I sit outside with my lover, admiring the scenery, the tempting curves of their body is pressed against me to keep warm.\n\nBeing outside in the snow like this immerses me in a special feeling. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2117.a;I like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2118.desc;I notice one of my courtiers - a sweet, innocent, somewhat awkward young man - is staring at my ample bosom while we talk. As the conversation dies down, he tries to awkwardly compliment me. "I admire your... large tracts of land.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2118.a;How dare you! Never speak like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2118.b;Sweetie... are you interested in something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2118.c;I’ll just ignore that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2118.d;Why yes, my tracts of land are very large!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_cougar_har_har;Seducing him is like stealing candy from a child… and I find it strangely arousing, to be able to control someone so innocent!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2119.desc;While visiting one of the local markets, I happened to see someone rather attractive. Sadly, before I could reach them, they disappeared into the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2119.a;At least it’ll fuel my imagination for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2119.b;I should ignore these temptations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2120.desc;I love my sibling. Very much. We have a special relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2120.a;I think we’re about to take our relationship to the next level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2121.desc;The people approve of my marriage to my beloved sibling. After all, we honor the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] with our holy union!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2121.a;Death to [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2122.desc;I've heard that foreign infidels scorn our ways. It is not the god or gods we worship, the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], nor our rituals that offend them. Nay, they think we are wrong for letting brothers and sisters consummate in holy union! Ridiculous, isn’t it? Who’d be insane enough to think that? They must have been misled by the false lies of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2122.a;I will pray for their souls, that they will see the true path one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2123.desc;Every time I make love to my sibling, I remember the holy words of the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Because I unite with my sibling, and not some random fool, it is said, I honor the heavens, fight against evil, and bring peace and harmony to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2123.a;There is no greater (and pleasurable) duty as a [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2124.desc;I haven't been making enough love to my sibling. Woe! What if I'm helping [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] and bringing more chaos and evil into the world?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2124.a;We must consummate our marriage once again, dear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2125.desc;Sometimes I find it difficult to approach my sibling romantically. I tell myself, however, that such doubts are only the evil, disgusting, terrible, cunning, unforgivable lies of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. I must love my sibling and spouse in all ways if I truly believe in the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2125.a;I must be strong if I am a proper [Root.Religion.GetName], no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2125.b;This is just too difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2126.desc;I don’t enjoy consummating my marriage with my sibling. Why? I must be a terrible and disgusting person to think like this, one who would rather embrace evil than love my sibling. Perhaps [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] wishes to draw me away from the from truth, from good worship of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. I must love my sibling more! I must know them in ways no other person can!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2126.a;I have to do this! I have to be a good, respectable person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2126.b;I'm disgustingly depraved and obscene but I can't help it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2127.desc;“Stop fornicating with your sibling like animals! It disgusts me!” proclaims one of your courtiers, a follower of a different religion. “You follow an evil faith! You must stop!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2127.a;No, my friend, it is YOU who follows the evil faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2127.b;Well… I’ll try to do it away from you… somehow…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2128.desc;I’ve learned that evil spirits, devas, are manifesting themselves in my residence. What misfortune! When I asked the priests of Zoroaster for their advice, they told me to make love to my sibling as much as I can. They explained that in doing so, the holiness of our union will inflict such doubt and pain on the devas that they lose the urge to harm and be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2128.a;That makes perfect sense. Let’s go kill these demons with our fraternal love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2128.b;Very well. Let me get my toothbrush first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2129.desc;They say that there are lands where people will kill brothers who lie with their sisters, and sisters who lie with their brothers. What a saddening thought, that evil has spread so widely in the world, when those who follow the true way and honor the heavens are persecuted and murdered for bringing light and justice to the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2129.a;I’m glad we live in a [Root.Religion.GetName] country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2130.desc;If only I had more siblings! I’d marry them all, and bring more peace and harmony to the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2130.a;Oh well, I must do with what I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2131.desc;I’ve heard that some lovers and spouses simply pretend they are siblings, to gain the approval of other adherents of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Such lies. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows the truth. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2131.a;These sorts of liars invite demons and evil into their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2131.b;Deception is sometimes necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2132.desc;A wise man has told me, “It is better for a [Root.Religion.GetName] to make love with a half-sister a thousand times, than make love with ten different sisters but only once with each.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2132.a;Wise words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2133.desc;The foreigner seems young and naive, as you welcome him to your court. He even proclaims, rather audaciously, "I've heard that in your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, brothers marry sisters and fornicate with them like wild animals! Ha ha, what a terrible joke my friends told me, don't you think? Obviously men who fantasize about their sisters don't have any to begin with!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2133.a;Well, actually, you're a bit mistaken, you see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2133.b;Oh? Is that so? Let me introduce you to my sister and wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2133.c;Oh? Is that so? Let me introduce you to my brother and husband...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_traveler_learns_about_incest;The traveler’s eyes grow wide, and his jaw drops. Poor fellow, he is in complete shock.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2134.desc;Today a holy man is visiting my court. He is telling us various anecdotes and proverbs, and one in particular strikes me. “Vain men who follow the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith ask each other how many of their sisters they have united with.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2134.a;I know those types.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2135.tooltip;Annoying, they can be. Not that... I'm one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2135.desc;He continues: “But a true follower knows that it doesn’t matter how many sisters or how many times, but rather how sincerely you love them. Be not vain, for [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows each man's true man. Just as it matters not how much you pray, but how sincerely you pray, to unite sincerely with a sister once is better than uniting with a sister a million times but without such sincerity.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2135.a;An important lesson we should all remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2136.desc;Another day, another foreign visitor insisting on debating against the [Root.Religion.GetName] custom of sibling marriage. The foreigner can argue all he wants about why uniting with our siblings is immoral. But he knows deep inside his heart that his Lie is evil, and that he is wrong and insane for believing his Lie.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2136.a;There is no hope against the Truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2137.desc;Hilarious! Someone lent me a book written by a foreign scholar that describes our customs, and it condemns our sibling marriages. Does this man not know the spiritual, societal, and physical benefits such unions bring? Does he not want a perfect society? Alas, we cannot help such dishonest, depraved, degenerate, debased fools who have been seduced by evil and lies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2137.a;Some people ignore the truth even if it was shoved in their face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2138.desc;People in faraway realms have some misunderstandings about us followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. They think we have intercourse with our siblings to encourage all manners of evil and filth. How wrong! We have intercourse with our siblings to encourage justice and righteousness, fight demons, and honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. To unite with a sibling is the greatest deed one can do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2138.a;Ha! It is they who are filthy and evil for not doing such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2139.desc;Sometimes I wonder whether the infidels are right, whether it is a good thing that we should produce offspring with our siblings. But then I tell myself to stop thinking these types of disgusting, unforgivable thoughts only idiots, madmen, and those deceived by [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] would believe. None can deny the truth, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2139.a;The glory of a brother and sister united is an irrefutable truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2140.desc;A local innkeeper has just prepared the largest falafel balls ever heard of in these parts - they’re as big as a newborn child! He has invited you to join in eating these delicious, big balls. Hummus will be served alongside these huge balls, of course. With the offer of so many tasty falafel balls, accompanied by delicious hummus, you can't resist.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2140.a;I want these big, beautiful falafel balls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2141.desc;I’ve learned that the local hummus merchant has managed to procure a fresh batch of delicious hummus. It is time to go into town and buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2141.a;I’m hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2142.desc;What sort of hummus am I interested in buying today? The hummus merchant has so many varieties available!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2142.a;I like good old plain hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2142.b;Hummus with some red peppers is my preferred type.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2142.c;Why not try some spicy hummus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2142.d;How about some nuts on my hummus? Lots of nuts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2143.desc;A foreign dignitary visited my court today. As I served him some snacks, out of courtesy, he tried some hummus - having never tried any in his life, he thought its sour taste meant that it was spoiled. The poor man vomited right there and then.Now that’s something you don’t see every day!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2143.a;Pity he can’t enjoy hummus! More for me, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2144.desc;You overhear some hummus merchants arguing about who invented the hummus. The Egyptian says the Egyptians did it, the Levantine says the Levantines did it, and the Jew says the Jews did it. You decide to intervene, as it looked like their argument was getting out of hand and they were about to start a scene in the middle of the marketplace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2144.a;The wise, ancient Egyptians must’ve learned the secrets of hummus long ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2144.b;The Jews are intelligent, obviously they figured out how to make hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2144.c;The cosmopolitan, shrewd Levantines probably came up with the idea of hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2145.desc;Bleh! There’s not enough hummus with my falafel - the dryness of these chickpeas is grating my throat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2145.a;Next time, I’ll remember to have more hummus dip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2146.desc;I put too much hummus on my pita bread.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2146.a;The flavor is overwhelming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2147.desc;I love eating hummus. I eat it with everything, everyday. The best part is, the physicians and wise men believe that hummus is a good and nutritious food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2147.a;Bring me more hummus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2148.desc;Utterly shocking. A hummus merchant living nearby was recently accused of using sawdust to add flavor and texture to his hummus. Now, it turns out that that was indeed the case! Thankfully, the fiend has been arrested and will soon be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2148.a;I bought hummus from this fraud the other day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2149.desc;My cook added too many different spices to today’s hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2149.a;Too many spices spoil the hummus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2149.b;It has a different taste, that’s all… I’m not complaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2150.desc;Today you want to be a bit more adventurous with your food (but not too much). You’ve been eating a lot of hummus and loving it, like anybody would, so your cook knows exactly what would satisfy you: msabbaha. It’s more or less the same as hummus, except with whole chickpeas, so it has a noticeably different texture.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2150.a;Now give me some pita bread!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2151.desc;This is terrible, absolutely terrible. One of my vassals has admitted to not liking hummus! Crazy, isn't it? What sort of self-respecting [Root.Culture.GetName] hates hummus? That's like a man saying he doesn't want to breath, or a bee saying it detests honey, or a tree saying it prefers to go without water.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2151.a;Crazy, crazy people out there, you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2152.desc;Lately, [Root.GetName] is becoming renowned throughout the world for the quality of its hummus. Travelers will even go there to sample fresh hummus. These erudite hummus connoisseurs would then gauge the quality of hummus made in various regions of the province, comparing taste, texture, and compatibility with pita bread, among other things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2152.a;Maybe I’ll visit there one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2153.desc;In recent years, it seems that hummus production has declined sharply in [Root.GetName]. People are starting to lose interest in the hummus produced here, and it seems like the hummus-makers here might not be able to recover from the inevitable catastrophe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2153.a;Sad to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2154.desc;Some people like putting a lot of hummus on their flatbread, savoring the intense amount of flavor. Others prefer just a little, desiring a subtler affect. Where do I stand on such an important issue?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2154.a;The more hummus the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2154.b;Less is more, obviously, when it comes to hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2154.c;I prefer to take the middle ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2154.d;I hate hummus. It’s overrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2155.desc;Strange question I was asked today. If I were stuck on a desert island, and could only bring baklava or hummus to survive on, which would I choose?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2155.a;Hummus of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2155.b;Baklava without a doubt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2156.desc;Merchants from afar offer you some samples of "hummus," a strange mush of chickpeas, olive oil, lemon juice, and other ingredients. It tastes a bit sour, and the merchants suggest I eat it with bread.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2156.a;I... kind of like it! I'll buy some more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2156.b;It's not horrible, but it doesn't interest me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2157.desc;Nothing's better than waking up and enjoying a hearty, healthy breakfast of ful medames - fava beans mixed with spices and oil - topped with hummus. It is said even the ancient Pharaohs of Egypt ate ful, but certainly they did not eat it in style with hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2157.a;The hummus certainly improves the dish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2158.desc;The best part about welcoming foreign envoys is not the feast, but what comes before it - namely the meze, a selection of small dishes served with drinks. So many things to choose, indeed, and one's hunger only makes it better. Yogurt, meatballs, eggplants, olives, beans, cheese - there's just so much to choose from.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2158.a;But best of all is the hummus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2159.desc;Local nobles from [Root.GetName] wish to prove their loyalty to you. As  [Root.GetName] is a world-renowned hummus producing region, they have decided to present you with a great offering of hummus. The hummus you receive is of high quality, with many varieties flavored with the most succulent spices and ingredients.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2159.a;Thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2160.desc;Ah! Excellent! Finally, a book written by an infidel that doesn't condemn our custom of brother-sister marriage.\n\nAs I continue reading the story, however, I realize I was misled. The story doesn't praise our sacred unions, it satirizes it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2160.a;Saddening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2161.desc;There is a sizeable population of infidels in one of your provinces. Many of them are critical of our practice of sibling marriage. In fact, some of these infidels - be they commoners, nobles, or educated men - openly mock and condemn such sacred unions in public! Surely this is an affront to the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2161.a;Those who insult [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]’s truth will be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2161.b;They can go to hell for all I care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2161.c;We must respect them, but in turn, they must respect us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_no_incest_hell;And obviously they will, for it is said in the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] that those who speak against sacred marriage and try to destroy it are destined for hell no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2162.desc;Seeing more and more marriages between close kin among the commoners is a good thing, so I am led to believe. I cannot deny that such marriages are always easy, but it is through our good actions that we will be able to uphold truth and justice, and fight the demonic forces of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2162.a;We honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2163.desc;They say that those who unite with their siblings will have beautiful children, for they honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2163.a;I am glad I found the right husband.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2163.b;I am glad I found the right wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2164.desc;I am reading some religious commentary on our noble practice of sibling marriage, and I come to an interesting part. Here, [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] tells lesser demons to not bother trying to ruin the sacred marriages, for it is possible to destroy the power of prayers and other good practices through deceit and evil, but it is impossible to fight the holy nature of a sibling marriage. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2164.a;These unions are so righteous, even [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] fears them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2165.desc;As I lie in bed with my sibling and spouse at night, I can't help but think how lucky I am to be not only married to such a good person, but also encourage good in the world in doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2165.a;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] must be smiling down on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2166.desc;I've found an ancient [Root.Religion.GetName] text, discussing various details about our world, some of which I did not know before. For instance, the first time one has intercourse with one's sibling, as part of a divine marriage, one thousand demons and two thousand sorcerers and witches die! Simply amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2166.a;If more siblings loved one another, we could solve all the world's problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2167.desc;I have heard that Zoroaster himself expressed doubts about whether sacred marriage between family members was a good thing. When I hear that, I strangely feel comforted, as I have sometimes had similar doubts about such practices. But I know in the end the truth can sometimes be scary and confusing. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2167.a;Better to know the truth than live a life of lies after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2168.desc;I passionately yet gently move my body against that of my sibling and consort. The pleasure we feel, as we become one, is heightened by the knowledge that we are doing good things in the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and fighting the evil of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2168.a;Our love is powerful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2169.desc;After another round of lovemaking with my sibling and consort, I feel as if I'm closer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the entirety of the universe. It's a humbling feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2169.a;There is a reason why our marriage is sacred, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2170.desc;Tonight, I go to bed together with my sibling once more. I hesitate, as I sometimes do, as our faces near, and we kiss. But our union, no matter how uneasy it makes us, is something wonderful and sacred, that will not be destroyed by the hate and evil.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2170.a;I love you, my sister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2170.b;I love you, my brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2171.desc;My marriage to my beloved sibling isn't always easy. Sometimes I wonder whether it was worth it. But truthfully, I think this is simply a test by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. My holy union with my sibling is a recreation of paradise - who said it would be easy?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2171.a;It can be paradise in other ways as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2172.desc;Some people think xwedodah, the sacred marriage, can also apply to cousins. One such courtier of mine expressed support for such a view. While these cousin unions might not be as beneficial as a union between brother and sister, or parent and child, the courtier argues they too have their own merits, please [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], and fulfill the requirements for xwedodah.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2172.a;I'm not against it… the arguments are sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2172.b;Heresy! Cousins aren’t close enough. The closer the relations the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2173.desc;What would the best type of sacred union be? Which family member would make the best spouse?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2173.a;Parent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2173.b;Sibling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2173.c;Child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2174.desc;Some within the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith argue there are circumstances when it is acceptable to abandon a sacred marriage between two family members. For instance, if a man was impotent and could not produce offspring with his sister, than it is acceptable to give her away to a good [Root.Religion.GetName] man so that more good [Root.Religion.GetName]s can be born.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2174.a;This is true. We have to be flexible and sensible with our beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2174.b;Lies! To end a sacred marriage is a heinous crime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2175.desc;Another foreigner visiting my court wishes to argue against our sacred tradition of marriage between close kin. This fellow is cleverer than most, however, and he mentions supposed legal issues with these marriages. Who is heir? How would an estate be divided? What would be the proper way to address someone in such and such a situation? And such things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2175.a;What matters is that we honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2175.b;You do raise good points...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2175.c;According to the legal commentaries written by…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_foreigner_impressed_incest_arguments;The foreigner is impressed with the legal arguments I have presented. He asks for a copy of the commentaries I referred to. Maybe he’ll convert to our faith one day. Maybe. Then he shall know the glory and pleasure our sacred marriages bring.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2176.desc;I dreamt of a world where brothers could marry sisters. Where sons could become closer to their mothers, and thus their place of origin. Where fathers could make love to their daughters. Where the sacred marriages of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith were widespread, accepted, and encouraged, where righteousness and justice were everywhere as a result. Then, I woke up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2176.a;I hope one day my dream will come true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2177.desc;Usually when travelers from faraway lands learn about our [Root.Religion.GetName] custom of sacred marriage between close kin, they show a range of negative emotions such as disgust or anger. This foreigner, whom I met today, is different. He seems politely curious, respectful even, and strangely open-minded as I explained things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2177.a;It's good to meet open-minded people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2178.desc;I've been thinking about how in different parts of the world, people have different customs. For instance, many regions do not allow for siblings to marry. We might think of such behavior as strange, irrational, and even repulsive, but to them, it's normal. It's strange how people can differ so much!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2178.a;Marriage with kin, however, is good. This is an uncontested, absolute truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2178.b;The more we understand others, the easier it will be to coexist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2179.desc;While walking around your palace, you hear two of your children playing. Your son is being pestered by his sister, who proclaims, "Brother, let's get married, married, married, married, married...";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2179.a;Adorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2179.b;They'll eventually grow out of that phase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2179.c;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] would be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2180.desc;You have a servant you've known for a while. You respect him greatly for he is kind, humble, and friendly. He is a good [Root.Religion.GetName] who married his sister. Lately, however, rumors abound that he has been reluctant to consummate his marriage with his sister. He also doesn’t seem to be himself. You decide you must help him, lest his soul falls into the clutches of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2180.a;It's time to stage an intervention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2181.tooltip;You and several others get together and figure out how to best carry out your plan.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2181.name;Let's Talk;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2181.desc;As planned, you approach your servant one day. You pretend that you want to talk to him about something. He does not suspect a thing as you lead him into a quiet room in your palace. Once he’s inside, he sees everyone else - friends and some other fellow servants - standing and sitting around. “Uncle? Dad? Wait - you, you’re that friend of mine I haven’t seen in…”\n\n“Please,” you tell him, as someone closes the door, “Have a seat.” ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2181.a;“We want to talk to you about something serious.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2182.tooltip;He cautiously sits down and asks, “What’s going on?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2182.name;Here to Help;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2182.desc;“It isn’t easy talking about this, because we know you might be going through some tough times,” you begin, “but we want you to know we’re here for you. We care about you.”\n\nThen, you all begin telling him your worries concerning his relationship with his sister. "We are worried that [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] could be deceiving your soul!" someone might say. “This is your decision, of course, but we want you to hear our opinions first,” someone else might say.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2182.a;Though silent, he listens attentively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2183.tooltip;The atmosphere is tense and emotional.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2183.desc;At last, when everyone has earnestly made their concerns clear, your servant begins crying. He admits it has been difficult, trying to consummate the marriage with his sister, but he greatly appreciates everyone's support. He promises to try his best, and the rest of you promise in return to help him whatever way you can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2183.a;Together, we can overcome [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]’s web of deceit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2184.desc;Every time I make love to my sibling, I use it as an opportunity to understand [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the universe better - after all, our sacred marriage is divine. However, lately my sibling claims my overly religious attitude is preventing us from being able to pleasure one another properly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2184.a;How can we do this without understanding its spiritual basis?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2184.b;I'm sorry! I should be more considerate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2185.desc;[Root.Religion.GetName]s who live in foreign lands ruled by infidels often have to deny that they practice of encourage sacred marriages between siblings, or between a parent and child. When asked by the authorities, they feign ignorance, saying such rumors are slanderous lies. If I were in their situation, would I pretend to loathe the sacred marriage as well? Or would I tell the truth?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2185.a;Even if it costs my life, I will defend the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2185.b;Lying is necessary if I am to survive in hostile lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2186.desc;Night falls, and I retreat to my bedroom with my sibling and spouse. I kiss them gently on the forehead, while embracing them, before we fall down together on our bed. It is time to please [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], once more, to consummate our sacred union, once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2186.a;The night is still young.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2187.desc;One of my courtiers had always been troubled by evil spirits, even possessed by them, some say. However, recently, these problems have vanished. Many are attributing this miracle of miracles to my divine marriage with my sibling, for such marriages between close kin undoubtedly bring fear and terror into the hearts of demons, after all, and even kill them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2187.a;Glory to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2188.desc;A courtier of mine is known for his skilled and articulate defense of our [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. He particularly is passionate about defending our practice of divine marriage between siblings and parents and their children. That said, he seems almost obsessed with defending this practice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2188.a;His fascination with incest is strange, even disturbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2189.desc;I have heard sad news from one of the provinces of my realm. An influential, local [Root.Religion.GetName] nobleman has converted to another faith. He was once a good believer who married his sister in accordance with our holy laws. Arrogant and foolish, he is now disgusted for some reason with his sister, and refuses to sleep with her any longer. He has even given her away in marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2189.a;A victory for [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]! This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2190.desc;A local noblewoman who married her brother in a sacred [Root.Religion.GetName] marriage has accused him of not performing his duty as her brother-husband as he refuses to bed her. The evidence seems to be against him, and, if true, means that whatever merit he would've accumulated from the sacred marriage in the first place would now be sin. She is appealing to you for judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2190.a;He will consummate his marriage with his sister, or face punishment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2190.b;I'm not here to give marriage advice. This is their problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2191.desc;I have talked with some merchants recently, men who have traveled far and have contacts in the great Chinese Empire to the east. They have told me that there, in this civilized land, the people think we [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Culture.GetName]s are lewd barbarians for we fornicate with our siblings and parents and children. How strange, that a civilized people could hold such a barbaric viewpoint!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2191.a;Only barbarians refuse to sleep with their siblings, parents, or children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2192.desc;After a large meal such as the one I hosted today it is typical to the give the trenchers - stale bread used as plates - as alms to the poor. One of my courtiers suggested I do this directly myself to display my virtue to all, instead of having my servants do it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2192.a; A splendid idea! Everyone will know me as generous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2192.b;I won't go near that filthy scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2192.c;I must meet and  help the poor beggars to understand their plight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2193.desc;People say I am generally in unusually excellent health. I asked a learned monk how this could be the case. After asking me many questions, some strange, about my diet and lifestyle, he concluded my good health is due to the fact that I enjoy eating bread crusts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2193.a;I see! I will continue enjoying them then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2194.desc;I haven't been feeling well lately, probably due to my poor health. My stomach especially has been feeling uneasy. My physicians recommend I eat some hardtack daily for a few weeks instead of bread to alleviate my problems, as it will help with digestion. Perhaps I will have to stock up on a large amount.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2194.a;I don't like the taste but I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2194.b;Why would I ever eat those disgusting bland things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2194.c;I'm pretty used to eating these with my troops, so I can do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2195.desc;I know everyone wonders why I always prefer to eat sangak - traditional Iranian flatbread - instead of other breads. But being a military man all my life, how can I not enjoy eating the traditional bread of the Iranian armies?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2195.a;It's a soldier's life for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2196.desc;You pass by the village just in time to see the local baker punished by the local authorities for constantly cheating his customers. He is dragged around on a sleigh with the offending loaf of bread tied around his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2196.a;Huh. How curious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2197.desc;You notice one of your courtiers feeding the birds out in your garden, throwing some bread crumbs to the ground for the creatures.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2197.a;Can I join in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2197.b;It’s of no interest to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2198.desc;I came across an old book on food from across the world. Most of it was damaged save for one section that discussed bread. There are so many types of breads, that can be cooked in a variety of ways. This information is really useful, and I see many applications for it - what bread is best used on military marches, for instance, or what types go with what food at feasts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2198.a;I’m glad I found out about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2199.desc;The young, attractive, shapely vendor offers you a taste of her big melonpan. They look so round, so cushiony, so creamy and beautiful. What man wouldn’t want something so tempting?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2199.a;I’ll buy some! Japanese sweet buns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2199.b;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2199.c;Oh, you meant that kind of melonpan… the bread, I mean, haha...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2200.desc;A local confectioner has developed a special new candy, which he calls “candy apples.” These apples are covered in an entire layer of hard sugar, and people say they are quite a tasty treat! The confectioner has given you some samples, free of charge.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2200.a;Yes, thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2201.desc;With the Aztec invasions, pumpkins have been introduced as a food crop. This year, some creative peasants have figured out something to do with pumpkins after they extract the edible part inside - carve faces on them. These carved pumpkins are both amusing yet frightening all the while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2201.a;Ha! I like them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2201.b;What a stupid thing to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2202.desc;Pumpkins may not be as popular as other foods from the Far West such as potatoes or tomatoes, but they sure have their appeal. You’ve taken a liking to roasted pumpkin seeds. Humble and simple they may be, but their appeal can’t be denied.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2202.a;Mmmm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2203.desc;Is there a difference between apple juice and apple cider? A courtier of mine claims so, and has been harassing anyone who can’t figure out otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2203.a;What a jerk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2204.desc;I ate too much candy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2204.a;Guggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2205.desc;I was browsing some wares at the market when I saw a foreign adventurer walking by. One of my guards sneered at him, and told the man in his husky, coarse voice: “We’re watching you… scum.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2205.a;That’s right, scum! You foreigners are no good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2205.b;Hey, hey, that’s no way to treat anybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2206.desc;You found an interesting play not too long ago, called the “Lusty [Root.Culture.GetName] Maid,” and decided to take some time to read it today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2206.a;Flip to a random page;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2207.title;The Lusty [Root.Culture.GetName] Maid;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2207.desc;\n\nMaid: I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not!\nMaster: Cleaning, eh? I have something for you. Here, polish my spear.\nMaid: But it is huge! It could take me all night!\nMaster: Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.\nEND OF ACT IV, SCENE III;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2207.a;This book is vile! I must destroy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2207.b;I don’t get it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2207.c;I like this. A lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2208.desc;What an excellent meal! Today your cook decided to do something a bit different, serving you foreign, exotic recipes. You ask your cook what was in that delicious sauce. The man thinks for a moment, before replying, “Powdered deer penis.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2208.a;WHAT IN THE NAME OF -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2208.b;Oh. Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2209.desc;You are taking a break from discussing war plans with your fellow commanders, and decide to start chatting with one of your guards. He tells you, “My cousin is out fighting infidels, and what do I get? Guard duty.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2209.a;Worry not, you’ll get an opportunity to kill infidels soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2209.b;Everyone does their part. Even guard duty has its honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2209.c;Don’t complain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2210.desc;You overhear one of your guards saying to another, I got to thinking, maybe I’m the Saoshyant, and I just don’t know it yet!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2210.a;Haha, that’s a good one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2210.b;Who knows?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2211.desc;I find one of my courtier’s wolfish grins unsettling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2211.a;Yeesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2212.desc;You pass by a [Root.Religion.GetName] preacher on the street who looks deranged. He screams: “[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] THE MIGHTY! [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] THE UNERRING! [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] THE UNASSAILABLE! TO YOU WE GIVE PRAISE! WE ARE BUT MAGGOTS, WRITING IN THE FILTH OF OUR OWN CORRUPTION! WHILE YOU HAVE - ”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2212.a;Heavens have mercy, he is annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2213.desc;In the market, you encounter a courtier, who doesn’t seem to recognize you and mistakes you for a lesser noble. The courtier says, haughtily: “Do you go to [From.GetFirstName]’s palace very often? Oh what am I saying, of course you don’t. I actually advise the [Root.GetTitle] on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2213.a;Why you arrogant little…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2213.b;Ignore the fool and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2214.desc;Before you land the finishing blow on the enemy soldier, who now lays, half-dead, crumpled, on the ground, he grins and says defiantly, “My ancestors are smiling at me, [Root.Culture.GetName] trash, can you say the same?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2214.a;You duly kill him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2215.desc;“WHY. WON’T. YOU. DIEEEE!!!!!” the enemy warrior screams as he lunges at you.\n\nMoments later, he falls down, dead, slain by your own hand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2215.a;He was too reckless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2216.desc;A foolish, foppish, silly-looking young man runs up to you, squealing with glee. “By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! It's the [Root.GetTitle]! I can't believe it's you! Standing here, next to me!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2216.a;Begone, pathetic worm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2216.b;Out of my sight before I am forced to kill you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2216.c;Don’t bother me, useless filth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2216.d;I will not associate myself with disgusting vermin like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2217.desc;The young buffoon seems to ignore your insults, and continues: “Wow! You're the [Root.GetTitle]! You're the best! Can I... Can I follow you around? I won't get in the way!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2217.a;Why don’t you wait here for a moment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2217.b;Beat it, kid, I don’t need you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2218.desc;"Here? Right here? What about, say... over there? No? Right here? All right then, you're the [Root.GetTitle]! Whatever you say!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2218.a;You and your entourage run away from the lunatic as fast as you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2219.desc;"Aw gee! You sure? Okay, well, I'll be hanging around [Root.Location.GetName] if you need someone to worship the ground you walk on. Bye!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2219.a;You and your entourage run away from the lunatic as fast as you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2220.desc;You visit a farmer in an effort to get to understand the commoners better. The man shows you around his farm, and the two of you come across his large cock. 'My hens love this cock, but unfortunately I'm thinking of eating this big, juicy, nice cock later today.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2220.a;Would you mind if I join you in eating that big, juicy, nice cock?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2220.b;Wouldn’t it be wiser to let the hens have their big cock instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2221.desc;You realize the egg you’re eating is a cock egg, that is, an egg without yolk. The peasants say such eggs are laid by cocks, hence their lack of yolk. They say if the cock egg were to hatch, it would hatch a great evil monster, the cockatrice, a gigantic, fearsome, big cock-monster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2221.a;Cocks are very strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2222.desc;A local peasant happened to have one of the biggest cocks ever seen in these parts. Out of respect, he has presented it to you as a gift. Thus, today, you and some your courtiers are enjoying this big, delicious, meaty cock.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2222.a;Mmmm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2223.desc;Cock a doodle doo!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2223.a;Will that rooster shut up! I’m awake, alright, I’m awake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2224.desc;On the side of the road, you notice a monstrous, vicious cock attacking a smaller, weaker, flabbier cock. It looks like one nasty mess of cocks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2224.a;The stronger cock deserves to beat the weaker one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2224.b;I’m rooting for the weaker cock to win against the odds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2224.c;These cocks are ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2225.desc;In the midst of our raid this time we captured a few healthy men, women, and children. They will be sold for a nice profit elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2225.a;Good profits indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2226.desc;While pillaging the settlement you come across two small children child. As you raise your weapon, ready to kill the miserable little runt, one child, who looks to be the older one, begs for mercy, asking that you spare their younger sibling. For some reason, you start to feel bad...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2226.a;Kill the older child and leave the younger one sobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2226.b;Kill the younger child and laugh at the older one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2226.c;Kill both reluctantly. The job has to be done - there can be no mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2226.d;Spare the two. Sometimes there are exceptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2227.desc;The screams of your victims fill you with delight, as you and your men haul away another stash of rightly-earned loot. The town you just raided surely was a good spot to do so, and you all had a lot of fun terrorizing the inhabitants too. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2227.a;The greatest joy for a man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2228.desc;When we looted the holding, we found a library of scrolls and books. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2228.a;Burn it, what is it good for anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2228.b;Perhaps we can sell this to someone who would value them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2228.c;I'd like to study them myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2229.desc;On raids, we usually take some of their women and do with them as we please whether they like it or not. Some of my men have rounded up a few girls and are inviting me to join in the inevitable orgy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2229.a;I'll join in with my men and have a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2229.b;I feel like I should restrain myself a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2229.c;No thanks. I prefer to disregard the females and acquire real loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2229.d;Leave those women alone, let’s just focus on getting some loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2230.desc;One aspect of looting I look forward to is when I take all the good food. Amazing, is it not - all these delicious ingredients and dishes, it's like going to an exotic market.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2230.a;Mmm mmm! I’ll take that baklava over there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2231.desc;"Aha! Caught you! Now die!" I shout as I jump around a corner.\n\nNothing is there.\n\nHmm. I could've sworn the peasant I wanted to slay was hiding there...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2231.a;No matter, back to looting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2232.desc;You have found a large stash of precious herbs and medicines in the holding you looted.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2232.a;We will bring it to our healers so they can make the best use of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2233.desc;While looting, one of your warriors snatched a valuable item right before you had the opportunity to take it yourself! Surely, since you are the leader, this man had no right to take what is rightfully yours?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2233.a;No, he won it fair and square.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2233.b;I will make him hand it over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2234.desc;It's time for me to buy a new wardrobe, somewhere to put my favorite clothes. My old one is worn out and will likely fall apart any day now. What sort of wardrobe should I get? A person of status such as myself can afford a decent wardrobe made of good quality wood, at any rate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2234.a;A simple one will do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2234.b;Something nice, a bit stylish, but not too much;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2234.c;It needs to be extravagant - with gold leaf, and intricate carving everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2235.desc;"Aaahh!"\n\nThe chair you were sitting on broke, and you fell to the ground, looking like a clown.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2235.a;Why is this happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2236.desc;There's nothing much to do while you're waiting for your food at the dinner table. Out of curiosity, you glance under the table you sit at. You almost puke as you see some disgusting mess - partly crusty and dried up, partly still icky and goopy - sticking to the underside of the table. Who in the blazes put that there? What is that, anyways, to begin with?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2236.a;Servants! I need you to clean up something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2237.desc;My desk is a mess! Papers, quills, ink, maps, charts, and other important things are strewn all over.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2237.a;It bothers me! I should organize this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2237.b;Nah, no need to do anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2238.desc;I was a bit too eager trying to get my hands on some loot, and injured myself slightly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2238.a;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2239.desc;While looting I’ve found a nice set of clothes - made of silk, and very fashionable too - that would look perfect on my wife. Not only that, but right where I found these clothes, I also came across a nice set of jewelry that would fit her well, too! This might make a nice gift for her… and these clothes would show off her assets very well too...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2239.a;Yes, I’ve save these gifts for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2239.b;Hmm. On second thought, I’ll just sell it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2240.desc;I have heard about how in foreign lands, there are people who think that marriage between siblings is a good idea. Obviously, these sort of fantasies only appeal to people who don't have siblings in the first place!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2240.a;Sick fantasies by desperate, depraved men, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2240.b;Then again, I should remain open-minded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2241.desc;I have heard of a man who lives in this region and is blessed with supernatural abilities, such as being able to survive any injury, even decapitation. Rumor has it that he acquired his abilities after accidentally encountering otherworldly spirits, particularly a young, immortal woman who is now his servant , and they now travel the land fighting demons and such supernatural threats.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2241.a;Tell me more about these stories...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2241.b;Nothing but fanciful lies, I'm certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2241.c;These pagan tales are an affront to our faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2242.desc;I'm partaking in some fighting exercises with my warriors. While shirtless, I practice some moves with my weapons. One of my courtiers, who happens to be observing the whole affair, remarks: "Your muscles are very good, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. They fit you well, the meat on your muscles. Yes, your meaty muscles look very delicious.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2242.a;Um... alright?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2243.desc;One of my courtiers was telling me something, while talking with a posed look.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2243.a;I decided to reply with an equally posed look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2244.desc;A courtier of mine seems to think I'm not being my usual self. He asked me, "Is something wrong?"\n\nI replied, "Oh, nothing."\n\nHe then says, "That time of month, then?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2244.a;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2244.b;Slap him in the face;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2244.c;Walk away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2244.d;Pretend he didn't ask that and talk about something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2245.desc;When I woke up, I realized I wet my bed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2245.a;Uh-oh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2245.b;I’m too old for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2245.c;Oh wait, this isn’t urine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2245.d;Wasn’t I dreaming of my sister last night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2246.desc;I was urinating, trying to aim my piss in such and such way, but I miscalculated and sprayed some of it on my legs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2246.a;Ew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2247.desc;Learned men tell me that the civilized peoples of antiquity rinsed their teeth with their own urine, in order to keep it white.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2247.a;This is a good idea! I should do often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2247.b;That's ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2248.desc;I noticed that lately my urine has a strange color...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2248.a;Probably just something I ate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2249.desc;I can barely hold it in! I'm in the middle of an important meeting with a foreign dignitary, and this man keeps going on and on without stopping, so I can't just excuse myself so rudely, but I really need to urinate really badly!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2249.a;Screw politeness! Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2249.b;Just bear through it, just bear through it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_gotta_go_1;I run to the chamber pot to urinate before it's too late!\n;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_gotta_go_2;Oh my oh my oh my I can barely hold it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2250.desc;Yes! The meeting with the foreign dignitary ended, the fellow finally shut up. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2250.a;I quickly make a run for the chamber pot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2251.desc;Oh no! I can’t hold it in anymore! Must… hold… it… in….\n\nDammit! I wet my clothes in front of everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2251.a;Er...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2252.desc;While making my way to a nearby village, I pass by a peasant relieving himself in a nearby field. He notices me and waves hello while he is still relieving himself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2252.a;Wave back (this is awkward);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2252.b;Walk away (this is still awkward);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2253.desc;Sometimes I wonder how people of the other gender urinate. I mean, I know where it comes out of - I’m not a child, I’m aware of these things - but I’m talking about how they do it. For instance, do they stand up? How do they aim it? Does it come out at a different speed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2253.a;Such important questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2254.desc;You encounter a stream. Since you’re feeling thirsty, you decide to drink some water from it. As you savor the refreshing taste of the water, you remember that upstream is a small village. You suddenly wonder if the locals dispose of their urine into this stream…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2254.a;Probably not… right? Right…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2254.b;I’ll just enjoy this water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2254.c;Unlikely, though, now that I think about it. Generally, the peasants would...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2255.desc;War. War never changes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2255.a;It doesn't, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] save us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2255.b;Our cause is true in this war, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2255.c;Humans are bastards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2256.desc;One of my courtiers has criticized the strategies and tactics I've been employing during this war. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2256.a;You have a point, actually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2256.b;Nobody questions me, the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2256.c;I should explain in detail the reasoning behind my cunning decisions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2257.desc;This war we fight has already cost many lives, and many more will die. Can I really say that I enjoy war?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2257.a;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2257.b;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2258.desc;While discussing war plans with a courtier, they give you a useful idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2258.a;Very clever! This will give us an advantage, surely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2259.desc;Even in your sleep, in your dreams, you think about this war. It's all you ever think of!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2259.a;Why can't I have a moment of peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2260.desc;It appears some of your soldiers have acted dishonorably towards the enemy while on duty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2260.a;Punish them. We have a code of honor to adhere to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2260.b;Ignore the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2260.c;Praise them! Our enemies will fear us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2261.desc;An old veteran has offered me some useful suggestions on how best to conduct the ongoing war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2261.a;His experience sure came in handy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2262.desc;It seems like the merchants supplying my armies have been unable to fully keep up with our demands. Though the problem has been dealt with properly for now, these turn of events worry me a lot, as our resources are stretching a bit thin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2262.a;We will have to make the best of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2263.desc;There are rumors among my troops that supernatural forces are working against us in this war. Whether these rumors are true or not, my men are increasingly demoralized!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2263.a;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2264.desc;An enemy spy has been captured! It seems like he was sent by your enemy in this war to assess your troops and your possible strategies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2264.a;Imprison him. Maybe he will reveal his secrets with some "encouragement.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2264.b;Behead him now, and send his head back to the enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2265.desc;I’ve heard that many of the peasants under my rule are not eager to partake in this war. They claim that they suffer a lot for what seems to be pointless fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2265.a;They should be happy, those useless pieces of filth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2265.b;Though we must fight, I do feel bad for what the peasants have to go through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2266.desc;Excellent! One of my spies managed to gather some useful information concerning the enemy’s movements and plans. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2266.a;We can use this information to prepare our own counter-plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2267.desc;One of my guards seems to be unhappy about this war. It seems he personally knows some of the soldiers fighting for the other side.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2267.a;They are your enemy. That’s just how it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2267.b;I’m sorry to hear that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2267.c;Now why do you know them? That sounds suspicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2268.desc;Sometimes I wonder whether this war will ever turn out well in the long run. Even if my side does end up winning, is that any comfort, knowing that we’ve only lived to fight another day?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2268.a;I don’t know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2269.desc;I wonder whether [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] approves of this war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2269.a;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2269.b;No, I would think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2270.desc;Someone wasn't looking at where they were going! A courtier has tripped and hit their head on a rock.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2270.a;Somebody, help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2271.desc;This rock is unusually shaped. I found it in my garden, and find it an interesting little thing, for it is beautiful, unearthly so, almost like a gemstone in a way. Maybe it is a good sign from [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2271.a;I'll keep it for now, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2272.desc;You pass by a large boulder, said by the peasants who worship it to be a holy object of immense spiritual power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2272.a;Pray a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2272.b;Sounds like a silly superstition, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2273.desc;Farmers nearby have discovered what appears to be the bones of some large, fantastical beast, trapped in stone. Or, at least, you think it is some sort of creature’s skeleton. It looks nothing like any being you've seen before.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2273.a;I want to study this. Maybe it is an animal from ancient times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2273.b;Doesn't seem useful. Grind it down to use in building, medicine, or something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2273.c;It would do as a nice, if odd, decoration in my house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2274.desc;While taking a drink from a stream near your residence, you observe the colorful, pretty pebbles deposited on the riverbed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2274.a;What shiny little things, these pebbles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2274.b;I’ll find the nicer ones and give them to my children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2275.desc;I have heard fantastical stories of how the peoples of Hindustan worship stones carved into the shape of a phallus, called “lingams,” and those carved into the shape of a vagina, called “yoni.” Quite shocking!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2275.a;Disgusting, sin-loving, heathen idol-worshippers, that’s what it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2275.b;That’s strange. Who the heck would bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2275.c;Maybe there’s a purpose behind it we don’t understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2276.desc;Lately a noticeable number of miners in several nearby mines have been suffering from various types of illnesses. They place blame on the kobolds, troublesome, evil, goblin-like sprites that are said to frequent these mines by embedding themselves in the rock and stone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2276.a;What news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2277.desc;A traveler shows me a special napkin he got in Persia. To clean it, he simply throws it into a fire, and after a while, all the grime and dirt is magically gone! He says that the napkin is made from a type of rock known as asbestos, which some say originates from the skin of the fire-breathing salamander.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2277.a;I'd like to buy that napkin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2277.b;It looks interesting, but you can keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2278.desc;I've been having some mild skin issues lately - mainly just some bad acne and rashes. The doctors prescribed me a cream whose main ingredient is ground sulfur.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2278.a;Hopefully this works!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2278.b;You know, I don't like the look of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2280.desc;Khichri isn't the most delicious or creative of dishes. That said, like everyone else, you see it as comfort food. Even as you eat it now, savoring the simple combination of buttered rice and lentils, you feel at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2280.a;Even the simplest of meals can be satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2281.desc;The paratha bread traditionally eaten by the peoples of Hindustan are often stuffed with various ingredients such as vegetables or spices. For today's dinner, my cook wants to know what sort of ingredients I want my paratha bread to have.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2281.a;The hearty flavors of lentils or chickpeas call to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2281.b;I have a desire for simple vegetables;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2281.c;Why not add in a good mix of spicy spices;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2281.d;As a person of prestige, I will go with succulent meats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2282.desc;Uh-oh. One of my courtiers just drank too much bhang lassi. Normally lassi is just water, yogurt, some spices, and at most a little fruit, but some adventurous types prefer this style of lassi which is prepared with liquid cannabis. "Yeah... lliiikkkeee woooaaahhh... mmyyyy [Root.GetTitle], did you... ddiiiddd you seeeee that?" your courtier says, trying to form coherent words.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2282.a; Alright, that's enough bhang for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2283.desc;There are rumors floating around that I recently tried some beef out of curiosity and liked it! ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2283.a;Me? No, no way. I’d never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2283.b;Well… um… it’s something I don’t admit to most, but there was one time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_evil_cow_eater;\n\nIt was just once, I swear! Anyways, so this one time, I happened to come across a...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2284.desc;As Muslim, Arab, and Persian influence grows in India, many people have started eating their foods and producing local variations. For example, they eat so-called "kebabs" made of skewered meat are becoming very popular. Even vegetarians enjoy a variation made with legumes or paneer cheese.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2284.a;Strange food... but having tried it myself, I admit it's tasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2284.b;Our cuisine will not be infected by them! Remove the kebabs! Remove them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2285.desc;A walking saint indeed! Stories of a humble and charitable holy man have circulated around these parts, about how he travels the region giving gifts to children and the needy and spreading good cheer. He is an inspiration to all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2285.a;That's good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2285.b;Bah, humbug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2286.desc;People say that Saint Nicholas, the charitable and kind saint from Anatolia, still lives to this very day in the remote parts of Spain, of all places, and that every winter, he travels throughout Christendom by giving exotic gifts such as citrus fruits!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2286.a;Bah, humbug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2286.b;Maybe Saint Nicholas will visit me someday?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2286.c;Feliz Navidad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2287.desc;I'm standing under mistletoe, but no one is or wants to be near me. I am alone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2287.a;I feel so lonely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2287.b;Bah, humbug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2288.desc;In a nearby town, I pass by children eating candy canes. They offer my some.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2288.a;Thank you, you kids are very sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2288.b;No thank you, but you are very kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2288.c;Bah, humbug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2289.desc;Someone has presented me with a nice gift - a wonderfully crafted nutcracker, painted with vibrant colors and made to resemble my own image. It'll be useful for eating nuts, of course, but they also say it scares away evil spirits as it bares its nut-cracking teeth at them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2289.a;Heh heh, let's go crack some nuts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2289.b;Bah, humbug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2290.desc;I noticed one day that there was a significant amount of moss growing on one of my palace’s walls. It was in a secluded, lesser-visited area of my residence, so it wasn’t something most people would’ve noticed, but it was no less an eyesore. For some reason, though I could simply let the servants remove the moss, I was feeling energetic and wanted to take care of it myself…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2290.a;Yes! A bit of exercise should do me some good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2290.b;It’s a nice thought, but let’s have the servants deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2290.c;Why should it be removed at all? Does it matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2291.desc;Traveling has always been dangerous in the unpredictable climate of the [Root.Culture.GetName] regions - a pleasant day with lukewarm temperature can suddenly turn into a snowy, life-threatening blizzard - so we traditionally stuffed our shoes and clothes with moss for insulation. However, while traveling a bit today, it appears I stuffed too much moss into my boots.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2291.a;It was really uncomfortable walking around, and I looked comical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2292.desc;While outside one day, enjoying the unusually pleasant weather, you come across a small pond surrounded by large boulders. On those rocks happened to be large layers of moss - enough, it seemed, for a good nap.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2292.a;Take a nap, admire the scenery, relax a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2293.desc;I pass a small river, and see a large turtle sitting by it. Actually, it just sits there, doing nothing, not giving a damn. In a way, it looks kind of formidable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2293.a;Lazy little bugger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2293.b;What a life that fellow must have! He seems to enjoy things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2293.c;Clearly it's a great spirit, and I should pay my respects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2294.desc;A large bird lands near you. Figuring it probably isn’t going to do anything, you turn away and resume chatting with your courtiers. "So, anyways,” you continue, “as I was saying - “"\n\n"SSSSSQQQQWWWWWAAAAAKKKKK.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2294.a;I turn around, but the bird seems alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2295.tooltip;Um... okay... never mind…. Back to the conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2295.desc;"Sorry, just thought... well, anyhow, like I said, I think that - "\n\n"SSSSSQQQQWWWWWAAAAAKKKKK."\n\nYou turn around, and the bird marches around as if nothing happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2295.a;Shoo! Go away, vile beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2295.b;Heh heh, what a silly creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2296.desc;I am at a port in my realm to discuss matters with some local merchants. While we take a break, I notice some seabirds - petrels, they're called - and walk towards them, curious. Suddenly, the sailors warn me not to near the bird - accidentally touching it might bring bad luck!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2296.a;Haha, oh look, I'm touching it! Really scary, huh? Pfft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2296.b;Oh dear. I'll keep my distance then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2297.desc;I noticed a bunch of toads gathered along the side of the road. Why are they here? I hurry along the road, avoiding the toads gathered for who knows what - toads are bad news, associated with the devil and all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2297.a;What evil business were they up to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2298.desc;I was walking by when I saw an owl. I paused for a moment, to observe it, but the creature dared to launch itself at me, clawing at my face and so on! My guards hurried in to scare it off, but the damage was done.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2298.a;What did I ever do to deserve that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2299.desc;They say that in Hindustan there live mice who move around by jumping on their hind legs, and are so small that they are the size of a tiny gold coin. Can you believe that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2299.a;What silly stories we tell our children and the gullible these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2300.desc;Your residence is home to a number of small geckos. Generally they’re tolerated in these parts because they are useful in getting rid of pests, mainly insects like mosquitos. But lately they’ve been getting on your nerves, interrupting your court, for instance, with their “tik tik tik” chirping noises.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2300.a;We need them, though. Don’t want the mosquitos bothering us again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2300.b;Chase them out! Pay someone to get rid of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2301.desc;Unfortunately, it seems that ridding your house of those geckos wasn’t a good idea! Mosquitos returned in large numbers, and you had to waste a lot of money buying some geckos from the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2301.a;What a frustrating waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2302.desc;A local farmer recently tried beheading a chicken, intending to eat it. However, despite losing its head, the chicken still appears to be living! It walks around and can be fed by dropping liquid down the hole in its neck. The farmer has given this curiosity to you as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2302.a;Amazing… yet disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2303.desc;A traveling troupe of entertainers is in your court today. Though most of their performances and shows are run of the mill and nothing remarkable, one event seems to be drawing a lot of attention: the corpse of a mermaid! It’s an ugly creature, with fish scales on the bottom and a hairy body and terrifying fangs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2303.a;Shocking! Shocking indeed! Tell me about how you got a hold of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2303.b;They insult my intelligence! It’s just a monkey’s head sewn to a fish’s body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2303.c;Wait a moment. At the neck… isn’t that a monkey’s head sewn to a fish’s body?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2304.desc;While outside with some of your courtiers, you all spotted some ducks. The silly way the ducks wobbled back and forth reminded you a certain courtier’s manner of walking...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2304.a;Heh heh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2305.desc;A small bird dared to perch itself atop my head! It sang a few notes, before I...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2305.a;Waved my hands around, to force it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2305.b;Let it stay there until it flew off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2306.desc;It's a rat? IT'S A RAT!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2306.a;Get rid of it, get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2306.b;Bleh, not like I care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2306.c;I will hunt it down myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2306.d;I feel sympathy for my brothers and sisters, the rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2307.desc;You stumble as you see the fox standing there ahead of you. This is not a normal fox, it seems, but one of the foxes from the mountains of Tibet that probably came down from the Himalayas for whatever reason. These foxes have a strange, emotionless face, and this one in particular gazes at you coldly with its thin eyes and unmoving features.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2307.a;Creepy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2308.desc;The population of wolves in [Root.GetName] has grown to such size that their attacks on livestock, once rare, have increased in number and are damaging the local economy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2308.a;Bad to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2309.desc;The fishing industry of [Root.GetName] is experiencing something of a boom. For some reason, the population of fish has grown dramatically, significantly increasing the amount of fish available. This will feed many families and also provide a lot of fish that can be traded elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2309.a;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2310.desc;My ear was feeling very uncomfortable this morning. While cleaning my ear with an ear pick, I managed to extract a gigantic piece of earwax from inside, one that was the size of a fingernail, it seemed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2310.a;Now I hear things so much better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2311.desc;Some have told me that wet earwax makes good lip balm. Given that my lips have been rather dry lately, perhaps I should try it. After all I really should present myself better when in public!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2311.a;That's disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2311.b;Yes, it’s a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2312.desc;The body of what appears to be a sailor washed up on shore close to your home. It appears the poor fellow got caught in a shipwreck or some sort of accident. On his ear is a golden earring - it is custom in these parts for Christian seamen to wear these earrings to pay for a proper Christian burial, should their drowned corpses be found.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2312.a;Find the nearest Christian priest and give this man a proper burial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2312.b;Ignore the corpse, the peasants can take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2312.c;That earring would look good on me - it's mine, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2313.desc;I keep hearing weird buzzing noises all the time. It's very subtle, though, and I barely hear it, so it doesn't really bother me much, but it's something that makes me wary. None of my physicians have been able to figure out what's the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2313.a;Probably nothing serious... right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2314.desc;A courtier of mine has been complaining about some sort of pain in their ear recently. Nothing else seems out of the ordinary, however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
