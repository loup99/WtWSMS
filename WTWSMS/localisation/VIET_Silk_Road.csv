VIET_sogdian_colony;Sogdian Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_colony_desc;A sizeable colony of Sogdian merchants, adventurers, warriors, nobles, farmers, and others dwell here, contributing to this province's economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sartapaw;Accomplished Sartapaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sartapaw_desc;This character is a well-known and important Sartapaw, the leader of a local Sogdian community. The term "Sartapaw" originated from a Sanskrit word meaning "Caravan Leader," although the Chinese equivalent, "Sabao," had more administrative connotations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.1.desc;You have shown ability as a Sartapaw, a local Sogdian leader. Having managed the commercial and diplomatic issues of the community for years, you've gained much experience and insight. The Sogdians may no longer dominate the Silk Road like before, but your ability as a leader shows that the entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit of the Sogdian people endures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.1.a;May the spirits of our forefathers guide us in these difficult times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.2.desc;You have shown ability as a Sartapaw, a local Sogdian leader. Having managed the commercial and diplomatic issues of the community for years, you've gained much experience and insight. The Sogdians are beginning to prosper now that the Silk Road has revived, and your ability as a leader is a sign of the Sogdians' enduring entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.2.a;May the Sogdian people prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.name;A New Sogdian Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.desc;Shrewd and opportunistic Sogdians have settled in large numbers in [Root.GetName]. These merchants, farmers, warriors, noblemen, and other colonists bring along with them connections to the massive Sogdian network that sustained the Silk Road. If this colony succeeds, it will bring us much profit and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.a;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.name;Sogdian Colony in Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.desc;The Sogdians in [Root.GetName] are beginning to desert their once prosperous colony in droves. It appears that this colony has failed, unable to bring profit to the greater network of Sogdians. Perhaps this spells trouble for the mighty Silk Road!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.a;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.5.name;Sogdian Colony Prospers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.5.desc;The once fledging Sogdian colony in [Root.GetName] has blossomed! In fact, the Sogdians now make up the majority of people in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.5.a;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.6.desc;Great [Root.GetTitledName], hero, vanquisher, liberator, conqueror, mighty among all men - you have proclaimed the Kingdom of Sogdiana. Driving out the barbaric warlords and invaders who have dominated the Sogdian homeland, you have proven that we Sogdians are not just cowards only good at commerce - we too, have a martial spirit! Sogdiana prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.6.a;And now we can finally start making some real profits again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.name;Triumph of the Merchant Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.desc;Once the Silk Road began to decline, the Sogdians, who once dominated it, began to decline as well. Countless waves of invaders ranging from the Turks to the Arab Muslims trampled over the once-prosperous cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and others. However, the great and accomplished [Root.GetFirstName] has made a name for [Root.GetHerselfHimself] by uniting many of the Sogdian principalities and cities under the Kingdom of Sogdiana.\n\nNow that Sogdiana is under centralized, stable leadership, it is likely that the Sogdian peoples might be able to reclaim their former glory not just in commercial matters, but military matters as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.a;It's time for us Sogdians to make some money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.b;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.name;The Sogdians Must Endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.desc;For centuries, the Silk Road stood as a beacon of light against the darkness, for it was a center of trade, of culture, of the interconnectedness of societies across Eurasia. Much of the Silk Road's prosperity was due to the industriousness of the Sogdian people, who held great sway over the commercial and religious networks they established across the ancient trade routes.\n\nRecently, however, with the collapse of the Tang Dynasty and the Uighur Khanate, and the chaos within the Muslim Caliphate, the Sogdians have no one to protect them. Despite their great influence, it seems, they relied on the protection and patronage of powerful realms. This will not do, of course. You wish to revive the Silk Road, and you understand well that it is only possible if you support the Sogdian merchants. You thus establish yourself as their protector and guaranteeor. With stability in Central Asia, it is hopeful that the Sogdians will once again prosper like in the days of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.a;We shall see to it that the Silk Road prospers once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.9.desc;Terrifying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.9.a;Terrifying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.name;Twilight of the Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.desc;The steppes and mountains of Eurasia are growing silent for the first time in millennia. Just a few mere decades and centuries ago, the realms between China and the Mediterranean bustled with commerce and the exchange of ideas.\n\nNow? A few merchants and pilgrims still walk the once-busy routes that criss-cross Eurasia, but they are an insignificant fraction of the massive numbers that once flourished on the Silk Road.\n\nSogdians... Khotanese... Tocharians... and more. The peoples who once prospered from the Silk Road are now shadow of their former selves. With the increasing chaos in the Muslim world, and the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, it seems unlikely that the Silk Road will be able to rise to prominence ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.a;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.b;As long as no one takes the riches we Sogdians worked hard for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.name;Night Falls on the Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.desc;The Silk Road.\n\nA road where fortunes were made and squandered. A road where empires rose and fell. Where culture prospered , where religions flourished.\n\nNow, a distant memory. Though merchants and their caravans still walk the trade routes of Eurasia, the profits they made now pale in comparison to the lucrative maritime traders of the Indian Ocean. The Silk Road, so it seems, has declined to the point of irrelevance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.a;I see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.b;Business looks bad for us Sogdians! Business looks bad indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.name;The Silk Road Lingers On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.desc;Not too long ago Central Asia was in chaos in the wake of the Muslim invasions and the subsequent disintegration of the Caliphate, as well as the fall of the Uighur Khanate and the Tang Dynasty in China. Yet, against all odds, the Silk Road still manages to encourage some degree of commerce and cultural interaction presently.\n\nPerhaps its stewards - be they the shrewd Sogdians, the devout Khotanese, the brave Turks, or other such peoples - still find use in the long routes that stretch from China to the Mediterranean.\n\nAnd perhaps, if these people are diligent enough in their work, the Silk Road shall endure its current state of decay, and once again be the center of trade and culture it once was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.a;We shall see if the Silk Road continues to rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.b;There will hopefully be many profits in store for us Sogdians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.name;Dawn of a New Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.desc;For centuries, they peddled their wares - silk, above all - across the unforgiving desert and endless steppes. For centuries, they preached visions of paradise and eternal peace, whether Buddhist, Manichean, Zoroastrian, or Abrahamic. For centuries, they prospered and flourished.\n\nNow, the peoples of the Silk Road have reason to celebrate again. Against all odds - the chaos in Central Asia due to the collapse of the Caliphate, the fall of the Uighur Khanate and Tang China, and the rise of the maritime trade routes of the Indian Ocean - the Silk Road is becoming a hub of commerce and cultural exchange once more now that the turmoil in Central Asia is receding, and China is once more reunited under the Song.\n\nHow long will this prosperity last? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.a;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.b;Greed is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.name;Fall of the Tang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.desc;Bad news! Reports have come that the Tang Dynasty has lost the Mandate of Heaven and collapsed, overthrown by a filthy rebel! However, rather than re-uniting China under a new dynasty, this move has only caused the country to splinter more. Now, rival dynasties and kingdoms have rose all over China, and the land - once the mightiest in the world - is now plunged into chaos.\n\nFor the inhabitants of Eurasia, even those not directly linked to China, this bodes ill. Without a stable, prosperous China, commerce will decline, and it is quite possible the Silk Road might collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.a;Not good news indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.b;What's a Tang?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.name;The Rise of the Song;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.desc;Encouraging news has come from the East. Following the end of the Tang Dynasty, China was plunged into chaos and anarchy. Now, a powerful warlord, Zhao Kuangyin, has successfully reunited all of China under a new dynasty, the Song.\n\nHowever, will the Song be able to achieve the power and prosperity the Tang once boasted? The new dynasty is certainly in a difficult position despite its success - surrounded by barbarian enemies, facing the daunting task of rebuilding the nation. For the inhabitants of Eurasia, however, there is hope that the Song will continue on the glorious legacy of the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.a;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.b;Where is China again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.name;The Rise of the Khitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.desc;In the wake of the Tang Dynasty's collapse, various nomad tribes have taken advantage of China's chaos. One of these tribes, the Khitan, have risen to prominence above all others. Under the leadership of the mighty Yelu family, they have swept into northern China, conquering many cities and provinces.\n\nDespite their nomadic origins, however, it appears that many of these Khitan have a keen interest in Chinese administration and culture. Perhaps they will one day become civilized, like all other nomads who conquered China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.a;Who knows what destiny lies in store for them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.b;Khitan? What? You mean Cathay? Or chicken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.200.desc;Some Sogdians living in your territory wish to serve you. It is important to note that the Sogdians possess a large network across the Silk Road, stretching from Cathay to Russia - it would be wise to take advantage of these connections, as they may serve us commercially, politically, culturally, even militarily!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.200.a;Welcome these Sogdians. Their greed is good for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.206.desc;Uighurs living in our territory wish to offer their services. Once members of a powerful empire, the Uighurs nowadays are renowned for their administrative and cultural talents. Employing them will surely improve our realm internally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.206.a;I will welcome them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.209.desc;There are a number of Khotanese in your realm, and they have approached you, offering their services. The Khotanese of the Tarim Basin are renowned for their piety as Buddhists, which endows them with much ability in the cultural sphere, and while their acumen cannot compare with the profit-loving Sogdians, they are also capable merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.209.a;Very well, I hope they will help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.210.desc;A few Crimean Goths under your rule wish to serve you. These are curious peoples, remnants of the mighty Gothic peoples who once ruled much of Europe, spiritually loyal to the Orthodox Church in Constantinople.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.210.a;I think we'll find use for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.211.desc;Centuries of Muslim rule have left the Iranian Zoroastrians in a difficult position, and many of them have fled to India. Now, today, some of them have come to you, offering you their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.211.a;Welcome these Parsis then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.212.desc;Talented Assyrian men have come to you, wishing to offer you their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_silly_gaijin;The Japanese men appear to be restraining themselves from laughter at your inept attempts to speak their tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.215.desc;Men from the tropical realm of Annam have come to you from afar. It's not exactly clear how or why they are here - perhaps they are merchants, or political refugees - but they wish to serve in our court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.215.a;Welcome them! I heard they make the best noodle soup in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.216.desc;Chinese seekers of fortune have traveled much of the Silk Road to come to our realm. They believe they can find suitable employment in your court. Since they come from the most sophisticated, urbane, just, advanced, and cultured empire in the world, surely the advantages of having them with us are many!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.216.a;I, for one, await the day when the Chinese will take over the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.217.desc;These men have come from a faraway place, Korea, traversing much of the Silk Road. Now, here, at your court, they wish to serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.217.a;I heard their music is good. Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.218.desc;Members of the local Chinese merchant community visit your court, and, impressed with your rule, wish to serve you as advisors and courtiers. ince they come from the most sophisticated, urbane, just, advanced, and cultured empire in the world, surely the advantages of having them with us are many!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He kisses the ground, and congratulates you on the New Year, and wishes you good fortune and prosperity for the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As the highest ranking member of the court, you have the right to choose whichever song you want the musicians and singers to perform first. There are many songs traditionally performed during Nowruz, and only Nowruz, after all.\n\nPerhaps you'd like to hear the grand “Nowruz-e bozorg”? Or the softer, more exotic “Nowruz-e Rahawi”? Or maybe the uplifting, spiritual “Bad-e Nowruzi”? Then again there is also the sweet, lovely “Takt-e Piruzi”...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
