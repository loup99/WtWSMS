VIET_sogdian_colony;Sogdian Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_colony_desc;A sizeable colony of Sogdian merchants, adventurers, warriors, nobles, farmers, and others dwell here, contributing to this province's economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sartapaw;Accomplished Sartapaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sartapaw_desc;This character is a well-known and important Sartapaw, the leader of a local Sogdian community. The term "Sartapaw" originated from a Sanskrit word meaning "Caravan Leader," although the Chinese equivalent, "Sabao," had more administrative connotations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.1.desc;You have shown ability as a Sartapaw, a local Sogdian leader. Having managed the commercial and diplomatic issues of the community for years, you've gained much experience and insight. The Sogdians may no longer dominate the Silk Road like before, but your ability as a leader shows that the entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit of the Sogdian people endures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.1.a;May the spirits of our forefathers guide us in these difficult times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.2.desc;You have shown ability as a Sartapaw, a local Sogdian leader. Having managed the commercial and diplomatic issues of the community for years, you've gained much experience and insight. The Sogdians are beginning to prosper now that the Silk Road has revived, and your ability as a leader is a sign of the Sogdians' enduring entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.2.a;May the Sogdian people prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.name;A New Sogdian Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.desc;Shrewd and opportunistic Sogdians have settled in large numbers in [Root.GetName]. These merchants, farmers, warriors, noblemen, and other colonists bring along with them connections to the massive Sogdian network that sustained the Silk Road. If this colony succeeds, it will bring us much profit and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.a;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.name;Sogdian Colony in Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.desc;The Sogdians in [Root.GetName] are beginning to desert their once prosperous colony in droves. It appears that this colony has failed, unable to bring profit to the greater network of Sogdians. Perhaps this spells trouble for the mighty Silk Road!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.a;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.5.name;Sogdian Colony Prospers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.5.desc;The once fledging Sogdian colony in [Root.GetName] has blossomed! In fact, the Sogdians now make up the majority of people in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.5.a;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.6.desc;Great [Root.GetTitledName], hero, vanquisher, liberator, conqueror, mighty among all men - you have proclaimed the Kingdom of Sogdiana. Driving out the barbaric warlords and invaders who have dominated the Sogdian homeland, you have proven that we Sogdians are not just cowards only good at commerce - we too, have a martial spirit! Sogdiana prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.6.a;And now we can finally start making some real profits again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.name;Triumph of the Merchant Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.desc;Once the Silk Road began to decline, the Sogdians, who once dominated it, began to decline as well. Countless waves of invaders ranging from the Turks to the Arab Muslims trampled over the once-prosperous cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and others. However, the great and accomplished [Root.GetFirstName] has made a name for [Root.GetHerselfHimself] by uniting many of the Sogdian principalities and cities under the Kingdom of Sogdiana.\n\nNow that Sogdiana is under centralized, stable leadership, it is likely that the Sogdian peoples might be able to reclaim their former glory not just in commercial matters, but military matters as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.a;It's time for us Sogdians to make some money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.b;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.name;The Sogdians Must Endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.desc;Much of the Silk Road's prosperity was due to the industriousness of the Sogdian people, who held great sway over the commercial and religious networks they established across the ancient trade routes.\n\nRecently, however, with the collapse of both the Tang Dynasty and the Uighur Khanate, and the chaos within the Muslim Caliphate, the Sogdians have no one to protect them, as they had relied on the protection and patronage of powerful realms. This will not do, of course. You wish to revive the Silk Road, and you understand well that it is only possible if you support the Sogdian merchants. You thus establish yourself as their protector and guarantor. With stability in Central Asia, it is hoped that the Sogdians will once again prosper, like in the days of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.a;We shall see to it that the Silk Road prospers once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.100.name;Twilight of the Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.desc;The steppes and mountains of Eurasia are growing silent for the first time in millennia. Just a few mere decades and centuries ago, the realms between China and the Mediterranean bustled with commerce and the exchange of ideas.\n\nNow? A few merchants and pilgrims still walk the once-busy routes that criss-cross Eurasia, but they are an insignificant fraction of the massive numbers that once flourished on the Silk Road.\n\nSogdians... Khotanese... Tocharians... and more. The peoples who once prospered from the Silk Road are now shadow of their former selves. With the increasing chaos in the Muslim world, and the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, it seems unlikely that the Silk Road will be able to rise to prominence ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.a;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.b;As long as no one takes the riches we Sogdians worked hard for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.name;Night Falls on the Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.desc;The Silk Road.\n\nA road where fortunes were made and squandered. A road where empires rose and fell. Where culture prospered , where religions flourished.\n\nNow, a distant memory. Though merchants and their caravans still walk the trade routes of Eurasia, the profits they made now pale in comparison to the lucrative maritime traders of the Indian Ocean. The Silk Road, so it seems, has declined to the point of irrelevance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.a;I see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.101.b;Business looks bad for us Sogdians! Business looks bad indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.name;The Silk Road Lingers On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.desc;Not too long ago Central Asia was in chaos in the wake of the Muslim invasions and the subsequent disintegration of the Caliphate, as well as the fall of the Uighur Khanate and the Tang Dynasty in China. Yet, against all odds, the Silk Road still manages to encourage some degree of commerce and cultural interaction presently.\n\nPerhaps its stewards - be they the shrewd Sogdians, the devout Khotanese, the brave Turks, or other such peoples - still find use in the long routes that stretch from China to the Mediterranean.\n\nAnd perhaps, if these people are diligent enough in their work, the Silk Road shall endure its current state of decay, and once again be the center of trade and culture it once was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.a;We shall see if the Silk Road continues to rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.b;There will hopefully be many profits in store for us Sogdians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.name;Dawn of a New Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.desc;For centuries, they peddled their wares - silk, above all - across the unforgiving desert and endless steppes. For centuries, they preached visions of paradise and eternal peace, whether Buddhist, Manichean, Zoroastrian, or Abrahamic. For centuries, they prospered and flourished.\n\nNow, the peoples of the Silk Road have reason to celebrate again. Against all odds - the chaos in Central Asia due to the collapse of the Caliphate, the fall of the Uighur Khanate and Tang China, and the rise of the maritime trade routes of the Indian Ocean - the Silk Road is becoming a hub of commerce and cultural exchange once more now that the turmoil in Central Asia is receding, and China is once more reunited under the Song.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.a;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.b;Greed is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.name;Fall of the Tang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.desc;Bad news! Reports have come that the Tang Dynasty has lost the Mandate of Heaven and collapsed, overthrown by a filthy rebel! However, rather than re-uniting China under a new dynasty, this move has only caused the country to splinter more. Now, rival dynasties and kingdoms have rose all over China, and the land - once the mightiest in the world - is now plunged into chaos.\n\nFor the inhabitants of Eurasia, even those not directly linked to China, this bodes ill. Without a stable, prosperous China, commerce will decline, and it is quite possible the Silk Road might collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.a;Not good news indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.104.b;What's a Tang?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.name;The Rise of the Song;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.desc;Encouraging news has come from the East. Following the end of the Tang Dynasty, China was plunged into chaos and anarchy. Now, a powerful warlord, Zhao Kuangyin, has successfully reunited all of China under a new dynasty, the Song.\n\nHowever, will the Song be able to achieve the power and prosperity the Tang once boasted? The new dynasty is certainly in a difficult position despite its success - surrounded by barbarian enemies, facing the daunting task of rebuilding the nation. For the inhabitants of Eurasia, however, there is hope that the Song will continue on the glorious legacy of the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.a;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.105.b;Where is China again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.name;The Rise of the Khitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.desc;In the wake of the Tang Dynasty's collapse, various nomad tribes have taken advantage of China's chaos. One of these tribes, the Khitan, have risen to prominence above all others. Under the leadership of the mighty Yelu family, they have swept into northern China, conquering many cities and provinces.\n\nDespite their nomadic origins, however, it appears that many of these Khitan have a keen interest in Chinese administration and culture. Perhaps they will one day become civilized, like all other nomads who conquered China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.a;Who knows what destiny lies in store for them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.106.b;Khitan? What? You mean Cathay? Or chicken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.200.desc;Some Sogdians living in your territory wish to serve you. It is important to note that the Sogdians possess a large network across the Silk Road, stretching from Antiocheia Eschate to Rus - it would be wise to take advantage of these connections, as they may serve us commercially, politically, culturally, even militarily!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.200.a;Welcome these Sogdians. Their greed is good for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.206.desc;Uyghurs living in our territory wish to offer their services. Once members of a powerful empire, while they maintain a sizeable presence, the Uyghurs nowadays are renowned for their administrative and cultural talents. Employing them will surely improve our realm internally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.206.a;I will welcome them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.209.desc;There are a number of Khotanese in your realm, and they have approached you, offering their services. The Khotanese of the Tarim Basin are renowned for their piety as Buddhists, which endows them with much ability in the cultural sphere, and while their acumen cannot compare with the profit-loving Sogdians, they are also capable merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.209.a;Very well, I hope they will help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.210.desc;A few Crimean Goths under your rule wish to serve you. These are curious peoples, remnants of the mighty Gothic peoples who once ruled much of Europe, spiritually loyal to the Orthodox Church in Constantinople.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.210.a;I think we'll find use for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.211.desc;Centuries of Muslim rule have left the Iranian Zoroastrians in a difficult position, and many of them have fled to India. Now, today, some of them have come to you, offering you their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.211.a;Welcome these Parsis then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.212.desc;Talented Assyrian men have come to you, wishing to offer you their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.212.a;I'll allow them to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.213.desc;Some Coptic Christians have approached you, for they wish to serve in your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.213.a;Sounds good to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.214.desc;Strange men from a land called "Japan" have come to us from afar. Though they do not wish to tell the circumstances of how or why they arrived, they wish to bring much honor to your realm by serving you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.214.a;So how do you say it, "Arigato... kimi-samaï... bakuraba... desu?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_silly_gaijin;The Japanese men appear to be restraining themselves from laughter at your inept attempts to speak their tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.215.desc;Men from the tropical realm of Annam have come to you from afar. It's not exactly clear how or why they are here - perhaps they are merchants, or political refugees - but they wish to serve in our court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.215.a;Welcome them! I heard they make the best noodle soup in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.216.desc;Chinese seekers of fortune have traveled much of the Silk Road to come to our realm. They believe they can find suitable employment in your court. Since they come from the most sophisticated, urbane, just, advanced, and cultured empire in the world, surely the advantages of having them with us are many!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.216.a;I, for one, await the day when the Chinese will take over the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.217.desc;These men have come from a faraway place, Korea, traversing much of the Silk Road. Now, here, at your court, they wish to serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.217.a;I heard their music is good. Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.218.desc;Members of the local Chinese merchant community visit your court, and, impressed with your rule, wish to serve you as advisors and courtiers. ince they come from the most sophisticated, urbane, just, advanced, and cultured empire in the world, surely the advantages of having them with us are many!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.218.a;I, for one, await the day when the Chinese will take over the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.219.desc;Near your capital there is a sizeable community of merchants and others hailing from the spice islands. A few of these men have recently approached you, for they wish to offer their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.219.a;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.223.desc;A Tibetan monk from the Himalayas has, so it seems, made his way to our court! Some say he is a wise, compassionate spiritual master, full of good qualities, someone who would make a good advisor and mentor. Others say he is a charlatan and fraud at worst and a misguided, nonsensical "teacher" at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.223.a;I think he would make a fine addition to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.223.b;Get rid of him! He can go beg for alms elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.224.desc;Tai tribesmen have reached our court, offering to serve you faithfully. The Tai are scattered across Southeast Asia and southern China, some dwelling in organized kingdoms, others in more disorganized tribes. They have been fighting amongst themselves for centuries, so now and then a few make their way to India to seek better lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.224.a;They could prove useful, then. Welcome them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.225.desc;The Tocharians dwelling in the oasis cities of the Tarim Basin are not as widespread or prominent on the Silk Road as, say, the Sogdians, but many still travel across Eurasia for various reasons. Today, a few of them have approached me - they wish to settle in my realm and serve me as courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.225.a;I see nothing wrong with that - go ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.226.desc;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.226.a;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.227.desc;A few men from the Okinawan Islands have arrived at my court, offering to serve me. Their homeland is an archipelogo located in between Japan and China, and though they are much weaker than their neighbors, their merchants do, on occasion, make their way to faraway realms such as mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.227.a;I am glad they have come here to live with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.228.desc;Khitan have arrived at our court, hoping we can employ them. They come from a powerful peoples, profoundly influenced by the culture as China, so much that they seem Chinese themselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.228.desc.2;A group of nobles hailing from the Liao Empire in northern China have come to my court, seeking refuge, for their realm has collapsed into chaos, with invasions by the Jurchens and internal strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.228.a;I hope they will culturally enrich us with their superior Chinese ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.229.desc;Mongol nomads fleeing their tribal infighting have made their way to my court. They promise not to cause trouble, and to serve you to their fullest capacity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.229.a;They are a welcome addition to our ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.230.desc;Scattered across the Levant are small communities of Arameans. Once an influential peoples in the region, their numbers have declined since the Muslim conquests. Today, prominent men from one of the Aramean villages of my realm have reached my court - they believe they have useful skills that I can make use of.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.230.a;Good, I am glad they want to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.231.desc;Jurchen tribesmen from Manchuria have made their way to my lands. They seek employment, believing they have better prospects with you than with their previous lords back home.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] can now do as he wishes, being the Mir-e Nowruzi. Thankfully his "reign" will only last a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.401.desc;This year we shall host a great fair and market in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], an opportunity for us to encourage trade and commerce in our realm. While we can hold a standard fair, there are other fairs traditional among the Sogdian peoples as well. The Fair of Max, for instance, is where idols are sold, and merchants of different religions exchange in an atmosphere of tolerance. Conversely, at the Tirmah Fair, defective goods can be sold - in the name of good fun, of course. Then there’s the M’xyrh Fair, where stolen or counterfeit things are sold - obviously the “stolen” goods are part of a fun tradition, rather than actual theft (usually).\n\nNow, let us send word to the Sogdian merchants and sartapaws, and to others along the Silk Road, that this year, we will have a...;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.403.a;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.404.desc;The fair at [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] is officially under way! Merchants from all over the Silk Road come to peddle their wares, trade their goods, and exchange contacts and information. Even those who aren’t merchants, be they commoners or nobles, can do some shopping, or enjoy some of the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.404.a;The silk must flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.405.desc;Unfortunately the Fair in at [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] has to come to an end. Merchants are leaving for elsewhere on the Silk Road. It will be a while before a fair of this magnitude will be held again, but you are happy you got a chance to participate in it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.405.a;I hope to host another one soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.406.desc;The Silk Road is like a glue that binds people of different faiths and cultures. At this fair, I’m meeting Manicheans, Christians, Muslims, Nature-worshippers, Buddhists, Hindus from places as far away as Iran, China, Russia, Egypt, Greece…. There are people from every corner of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.406.a;Talk with the foreigners to understand their ways and language;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.406.b;Engage in friendly religious discussion and debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.desc;During the fair, I’ve encountered two men apparently in a heated argument of a religious nature. This isn’t an uncommon sight here in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], even on days when business is slow. On the Silk Road, after all, there are many different religions, so it’s not implausible that some hot-headed people take things too far.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.a;Observe their theological debate and mud-slinging;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.b;Cheer for one side;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.c;Try to resolve the dispute - we shouldn't be arguing like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.d;Try to resolve the dispute - we must be tolerant during the Fair of Max!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.408.desc;There’s a reason why they call it the Silk Road, no? While I’m at the fair here, why don’t I take the opportunity to buy some quality silk? I could use the silk to…;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.409.d;A few strong horses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.410.desc;A Chinese and Sogdian man have come to you due to a dispute during the fair. The former claims that the latter sold him a slave girl claiming she was born a slave and not a free person forced into slavery, but the girl turned out to be the latter, which is illegal in China, so he can't bring her home with him. The Sogdian, though, says he never lied and told the truth from the start.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_chinese;\nThe Sogdian merchant, obviously, either lied or is an idiot. Any decent merchant would be familiar with Chinese law and know that this Chinese man would not be allowed to bring the slave girl legally into China.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_sogdian;\nThe Chinese merchant should have been more careful with his purchase. Though the Sogdian merchant may have been crafty, it is the fault of the buyer for not inspecting the goods better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_neither;\nThe merchants shouldn't have come to me, do I look like a person who wants to deal with this?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_tirmah;\nThe Chinese merchant should realize we have a Tirmah Fair this year. Shoddy goods can be sold, as long as buyers are aware of it - it's all in good fun, after all! Those arrogant Chinese should learn about others' customs first!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.desc;Slaves are often sold at these fairs. Girls from the region, known for their beauty, are popular among discerning customers from places as far as China. Today I've found a most lovely young lady - she will surely make a good consort!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.a;She will serve me, of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.b;She would make a good present for my relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.413.desc;Sogdian music and dance is popular in many lands, in places as far away as China and Japan. During these fairs, both foreigners and natives, myself included, come to watch Sogdians musicians and dancers perform their art.;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.416.desc;The best part of these fairs is obviously the food! Since people come from all across the Silk Road, there are a lot of different cuisines. There's local boiled meats and vegetables, as well as flat breads, pilaf, and nutty, syrupy sweets of course, but also more exotic dishes like Chinese noodles, Indian curries, and Greek baklava.

silkroad.417.desc;In the midst of the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], I have met with several other fellow sartapaws - some local, some from places afar - to discuss about various matters pertaining to trade and how our communities and trade networks can better help one another.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.417.a;This was an important meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.418.desc;In the midst of the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], I have met with several other fellow sartapaws - some local, some from places afar - and have learned of various news concerning political stability and commercial prospects in other regions.;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.419.a;This new business relationship should be profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.420.desc;In the midst of the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], I have met with several other important sartapaws - some local, some from places afar - to socialize and learn more about the customs and cultures of the other regions they hail from, things that I may not have known beforehand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.420.a;This gathering was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.421.desc;Manichean priests have set themselves up along the streets of [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. They use large paintings in their sermons, to explain their religion more easily to everyone, especially illiterate peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.421.a;Spend some time listening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.421.b;Ignore them and move on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.422.desc;You meet a few Buddhist monks traveling on a pilgrimage to India, who are resting in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] while the fair is going on. They seem friendly enough... maybe you could talk with them a bit?;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.422.a;Engage in fruitful spiritual discussion with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.422.b;Ignore the monks - I don't have a good feeling about them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.423.desc;I see a group of Hindu merchants nearby, discussing business. Accompanying them is a lone, Hindu hermit. He seems wise despite his old, haggard appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.423.a;Pay my respects, maybe talk a bit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.423.b;Avoid these heathen idolaters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.424.desc;Nestorians have historically formed the bulk of the Christian community along the Silk Road, on including here in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. I see a Nestorian merchant who, besides his normal wares, sells crosses and other religious objects to the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.424.a;Talk with him and his customers about their faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.424.b;Move on to another stall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.desc;During the fair, I come across a group of merchants praying. They are pious Muslims, it seems, who do their best to pray five times a day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.a;Talk with them about their faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.b;Go elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.c;Join them in prayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.426.desc;There are many merchants here who sell specially-crafted idols, lovely objects. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.426.a;Discuss these idols with the merchants and customers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.426.b;Bah, they’re just selling people cheap objects of no use;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.426.c;False idols! False idols!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.desc;Jews make up a noticeable minority on the Silk Road, so it’s no surprise to see them at fairs like the one I’m currently having in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. While exploring the bazaars, I came across a group of Jews arguing - something about scripture, or logic, or interpretation, something of a theological or religious nature.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.a;Try to understand what they’re arguing about;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.b;Ha ha, the silly Jews, always arguing…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.c;I should join in their argument myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.428.desc;At the Tirmah Fair merchants are allowed to sell shoddy products. In reality, though, it is a contest between merchants won by those who can sell defective products. Some do it by manipulating and persuading potential buyers, others do it by finding creative ways to advertise their products. Buyers traditionally ‘reward’ the cleverest merchants by buying their shoddy products.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.428.a;I admire the former method - it takes skill to hoodwink others;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.428.b;I find the latter method more admirable - it's great seeing all the ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.429.desc;Oh no! I bought this defective product on a whim and now I can't return it. At the Tirmah Fair, that's what's supposed to happen - people buy and sell defective products for fun - but I've realized I really don't have a use for this anywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.429.a;Damn, that merchant fooled me good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.429.b;But perhaps… I can trick someone else into buying this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.430.desc;It's really fun trying to see what defective products people sell at the Tirmah Fair. It's a Sogdian tradition that's endured for centuries now. People find lots of unusual, interesting ways to use the seemingly shoddy items they buy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.430.a;This bent toothbrush here, for instance, could be a nice decoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.433.desc;At the M'xyrh Fair, people sell "stolen" products. In fact these products are simply "stolen" by friends or family as part of a game, so to speak, all in good fun. People are vigilant during the fair, trying not to get their items stolen, while at the same time waiting for opportunities to steal from others themselves. Anyone is allowed to sell or buy these "stolen" items.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.433.a;I wasn't wary enough, and my courtier stole something from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.433.b;I've managed to steal something from a courtier this year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.434.desc;A thief has been brought before me. Although people are supposedly allowed to steal and sell their stolen products at the M'xyrh Fair, this is in fact just a game friends and family play with each other. Real theft is not acceptable, but it happens from time to time, with lowly ruffians thinking they can take advantage of the atmosphere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.434.a;Punish the thief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.434.b;Be lenient on the thief - after all, this fair "celebrates" theft, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.435.desc;Curses! A real thief stole some valuables of mine during the M'xyrh Fair. Usually during the fair only family and friends are supposed to "steal" from each other, as part of the festivities. However, it's certain that a real thief was behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.435.a;This is very upsetting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.436.desc;You meet a merchant from Karghalik at the fair. His people specialize in the cultivation of a special plant the Chinese call “baicao,” or “white grass.” Its extract is poisonous, and can be used on arrow points and kills immediately. Though he doesn’t sell the “baicao” to most of his normal customers, since you are a [Root.GetTitle], he says he can get you some for a special price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.436.a;Sounds good! It might come in handy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.436.b;Look here, I’m not interested in shady dealings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.437.desc;You encounter a noblewoman you recognize at the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. She has with her a lovely horse she just bought, and tells you its one of the horses from Barkol, whose people are renowned for their horse breeding. When asked where she got her new steed, she points to a horse merchant nearby, but says that the horse won’t be cheap.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.437.a;Hmm. I guess I can chalk up the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.437.b;Nah, doesn’t look like it’s worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.desc;A merchant from the hinterlands of the Fergana valley invites you over to his stall. The valley has been famous since ancient times for its fruits, particularly its grapes, which are made into wines, and this merchant tries to convince you to try some his produce and buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.a;I’ll take a few fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.b;The wine looks good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.c;No thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.439.desc;You are browsing the wares of various merchants at the fair when you see a crowd up ahead. Curious, you make your way and see what all the fuss is about. It turns out to be a pair of traveling musicians, one playing a lute, the other playing a pipe. Listening carefully for a while, you recognize their style of music as being from Kucha. The city is famous for its talented musicians.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.439.a;It’s great to hear something like this after so long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.440.desc;While browsing one merchant’s merchandise at the fair, you come across some rather fine haircloth - that is, a stiff fabric typically made from horse or camel hair. Though hardy and practical, haircloth tends to be ugly, but this one doesn’t look too bad. When the merchant tells you the cloth comes from Baluka, a kingdom renowned for its haircloth, you consider buying it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.440.a;Yes, it will do. Can’t be wearing fine silks all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.440.b;No, on second thought, I don’t need this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.441.desc;The size of those watermelons! So large, so round, so juicy! You hurry over to the merchant and ask him about the watermelons. He says they are from the farms around Samarkand. No surprise, then, where else could anyone find such lovely round melons? He said it was a difficult journey, hauling them over to [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] from Samarkand, but says judging by his profits so far it was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.441.a;Now let me buy some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.441.b;As much as I want these watermelons, I have to save my money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.442.desc;You have spent much of the day at the fair, and are very thirsty, when you hear one of the vendors cry out: “Get your pomegranate juice here! Fresh, authentic pomegranate juice from Khudjend!” Interested, you hurry over and ask the vendor about his pomegranate juice. “I make mine from a recipe my mother taught me years ago. It’s a secret, though!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.442.a;Sounds good, sounds good, now I’ll have some please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.442.b;It’s pomegranate juice, how hard can it be? Anyways, I’ll buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.desc;Walking around the fair is exhausting, so I’ve decided to visit some of the food and drink vendors to see what they offer. One vendor is selling a rather strange-looking beverage. When inquired about it, he says it is a traditional Kipchak drink made from fermented honey. He learned how to make it when he traveled to the lands of the Kipchak nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.a;I see. I’ll have some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.b;Are you sure you’re making it right? I have Kipchak blood you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.c;Hmm. On second thought, never mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.desc;An old scholar is here in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] at the fair. He offers to sell me some old books and scrolls. Browsing through them, they appear to be written in a variation of the ancient Indian script. It could be of use, as the scholar says these hold many great wisdoms…;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.a;I’m sure some of my scholars will be able to decipher its contents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.b;Oh wait, I recognize the language. I think I want to study these, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.c;Why would I want these useless pieces of paper?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.445.desc;“Ostrich eggs! Ostrich eggs! Ostrich eggs from ostriches in Arabia! Best Ostrich eggs at the [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] fair! Get your Ostrich eggs here! Ostrich eggs!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.445.a;Oooh! Ostrich eggs! I want to try some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.445.b;I didn’t come to the fair for some stupid fad of a food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.446.desc;A horse merchant is here at the fair, claiming to breed horses in the wild areas of the Fergana valley. He claims, rather boldly, that the horses of Ferghana such as those he sells are always of wonderful quality because these breeds are from the strain of a supernatural stallion, a gift from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.446.a;I’m interested in that horse over there, yes, that one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.446.b;A likely tale! Ha! I’ve heard better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.desc;At the fair I’ve met a number of Sogdian merchants. One of them in seems to have made a fortune on the trade routes connecting to the city of Turfan, nicknamed “Chinese Town” by the Sogdians due to its large Chinese presence. He claims the brothels there are some of the best in the world, its beautiful courtesans having pleasured travelers and merchants for centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.a;I’d like to visit there someday!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.b;Well… that’s interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.c;Excuse me, would you mind not talking about such lewd things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.448.desc;Talking with some of the merchants who have traveled from far-away lands to our fair has proven to be quite fascinating. Many of these men have seen so many in these travels, and sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever get to see the massive Buddha statues of Bamiyan, the Cave of a Thousand Buddhas in Mogao, the Great Wall of China, or the highest peaks of the Himalayas.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.448.a;Maybe someday?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.449.desc;One merchant here at the fair is selling a wide variety of precious items from China, particularly jade.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.449.a;I want this jade amulet here…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.449.b;Jade is overrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.desc;A merchant has come here all the way from Khotan, bringing with him luxurious jade and silk manufactured in that city - the Khotanese are in fact one of the few peoples outside of China who can make these products on such a large scale. Nevertheless, due to the precious nature of these items, I better hurry before they're sold out at this fair.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.a;Some jade, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.b;I'll take that silk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.c;Why not both, jade and silk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.d;Ha! Second-rate imitations of the real, quality Chinese products!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.desc;There is a merchant here at the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] who trades in precious jewels and stones. Perhaps I should buy some, and commission a local jeweler to make me something lovely? Currently, the following gems are still on sale: lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, diamonds from the heart of India, turquoise all the way from China, and amber from the cold forests of the north.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.a;Lapis Lazuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.b;Diamonds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.c;Turquoise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.d;Amber;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.desc;At the fair, a merchant is offering to sell me some beautifully carved ivory, made from the tusks of Indian elephants, for a rather low price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.a;Sure! I’ll buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.b;No, not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.c;How cruel it is to extract this mercilessly from the elephants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.453.desc;There are some Persian rugs on sale at this fair. I’m considering buying some to decorate my palace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.453.a;Should be worth it, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.453.b;Hmm… on second thought, I don’t need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.454.desc;“MANGOES ALL THE WAY FROM MULTAN! GET YOUR MANGOES HERE! FRESH, JUICY MANGOES!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.454.a;Mmm! Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.454.b;No thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.455.desc;One merchant at this fair has a fine selection of spices from all across the world - India, China, Africa, Persia, and elsewhere. I see pepper, saffron, cumin, tumeric, cloves, and more. I must buy some of these, so my cook can use them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.455.a;Let’s see… which ones would I like…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.455.b;But, then again, I don’t need a lot of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.desc;At the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], you come across a few Zoroastrians preparing a large statue to be used in one of the upcoming events.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.a;Admire their work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.b;Idol! False idols!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.c;It doesn’t look that interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.457.desc;Oh, what a poor fool [FROM.GetFirstName] was! [From.GetSheHe] bought a defective product at the Tirmah Fair without realizing at first, and how [From.GetSheHe] regrets it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.457.a;What a pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
