VIETmisc.331.desc;The Ibadi sect of Islam has always been under threat from the more powerful Sunnis and Shiites.

As the Mozabite tribe grows in power and size, some of them have banded to form a trans-regional holy order! With the Ibadi sect spreading across the world, it may face threats not only from Sunni and Shiite rulers, but those of other faiths as well, so the rise of the Mozabites could not have come at a more opportune time for the Ibadi faithful. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
