A late Arabic writer wrote of the Sabaeans that they had seven temples dedicated to the seven planets, which they considered as intermediaries employed in their relation to God. Each of these temples had a characteristic geometric shape, a characteristic color, and an image made of one of the seven metals. They had two sects, star and idol worshipers, and the former held their doctrine to come from Hermes Trismegistus through the prophet Adimun.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ashurism_pagan;Babylonian Ashurism;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashurism_pagan_DESC;Assyrians once lived under the rule of the Babylonians, and their religion, while still venerating Ashur as the king, was mostly syncretized with the Babylonian faith. During the Babylonian era, Ashurism was a branch of the Babylonian religion, whose main gods were based around nature. This "primordial", Babylonian form of Ashurism was the first religion of the Assyrians when they were under Babylonian rule. They believed a spirit possessed every object in nature. Like their successor faith, Asshur was seen as the king of all gods. In contrast with the later Assyrian religion, nature spirits were worshipped under Asshur, as compared to the deities of the Assyrians. The other primary gods are based around nature: Anu was the god of heaven and space, Bel (also called Belus) was the god of the earth, of war, of beasts, and of birds. Ea was the god of water and Sin was the moon god. Shamash was the sun god, and Ramman was the god of storms. Many other gods follow these such as the five planet gods and hundreds of lesser gods they would make make offerings to in order to gain blessings. As with the Babylonians, clergymen were called Bares (literally "inspectors") and divined by viewing sacrificial animals' livers and astrology. For the purposes of this Mod, Babylonian Ashurism is a heresy of the true religion of an independent Assyria, and has dramatically different ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;x

hattusa_DESC;The Hattusa religion was a vague religion meaning that there are no canonical scriptures, no theological disquisitions or discourses, no aids to private devotion.

The scribes in the royal administration, some of whose archives survive, were a bureaucracy, organizing and maintaining royal responsibilities in areas that would be considered part of religion today: temple organization, cultic administration, reports of diviners, make up the main body of surviving texts. There are a few images of deities, for the Hittites often worshiped their gods through Huwasi stones, which represented deities and were treated as sacred objects. Gods were often depicted standing on the backs of their respective beasts, or may have been identifiable in their animal form.;;;;;;;;;;;x

naassenes_DESC;The Naassenes were a Gnostic sect from around 100 AD known only through the writings of Hippolytus of Rome. The Naassenes claimed to have been taught their doctrines by Mariamne, a disciple of James the Just.

Hippolytus regards them as among the first to be called simply "Gnostics", alleging that they alone have sounded the depths of knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;x

boborites_DESC;The Borborites possessed certain sacred books, one called Noria, a Gospel of Eve, Books of Seth, Revelations of Adam, etc. They used both the Old and New Testament, but did not acknowledge the God of the Old Testament as the supreme deity. They taught that there were eight heavens, each under a separate archon. In the seventh reigned Sabaoth, creator of heaven and earth, the God of the Jews, represented by some Borborites under the form of an ass or a hog, hence the Jewish prohibition of swine's flesh. In the eighth heaven reigned Barbelo, the mother of the living, the Father of All, the supreme God, and Christ. They denied that Christ was born of Mary, or had a real body, and also the resurrection of the body. The human soul after death wanders through the seven heavens, until it obtains rest with Barbelo. According to Augustine they taught that the soul was derived from the substance of God, and hence could not be polluted by contact with matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Some Babylonian texts were even translations into Akkadian from the Sumerian language of earlier texts, though the names of some deities were changed in Babylonian texts. Many Babylonian deities, myths and religious writings are singular to that culture for example, the uniquely Babylonian deity, Marduk, replaced Enlil as the head of the mythological pantheon.
