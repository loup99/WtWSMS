EVTOPTBancrel.3000;No point in chasing the impossible...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.3001;The greatest heroes were those who took part in the Trojan War. Admirable qualities could be found on both sides of that terrible war, but still you must decide, from which side will your heroic muse come?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBancrel.3001;The Trojans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.3002;Of the epic heroes who sided with the Greeks, there were three who stood out as exemplars, which shall you choose to emulate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.3002;I shall endeavour to be like the mighty Achilles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.3010;One of your favored courtesans has been saying flattering, if a bit indiscrete, things about your skills in the bedroom.

EVTOPTAancrel.3010;I am pretty great, aren't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.3013;In the final battle to take the enemy town you found yourself overwhelmed with the thrill of combat and charged headlong into the enemy ranks. Before long you were surrounded, far from your personal guard. But this did not deter you. Instead, you single-handedly cut down thirty men. But, if you were to listen to the rumors that have been circulating through [From.GetBaseName] it was more like 300! Some say that you were the image of Achilles himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.3013;All I can remember is the exhileration...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
