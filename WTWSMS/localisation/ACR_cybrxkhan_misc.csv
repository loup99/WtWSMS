ancrel.4104.desc;Curses! The Nile flood is paltry and weak this year. Egyptians everywhere worry, as the harvest might be inadequate, leading to hunger and even starvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_province_desecrated_egyptian_tombs_desc;Somebody's been ransacking ancient tombs in this province... the gods will punish them in the afterlife. Hopefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_not_upholding_maat;Not Upholding Ma'at;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_not_upholding_maat_desc;"You're a terrible ruler! You should be ashamed of yourself! When your heart is judged by Osiris in the afterlife, he shall see the imbalance in your Ma'at and you will be thrown to the terrible beast Ammit!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.desc;In olden times, the people of Egypt valued that most wonderful and delicious vegetable, garlic. It pleased the Gods and was used to take oaths. Perhaps it would be a good idea to order large quantities to garlic to be distributed to the temples scattered across our realm!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.a;Yes, let's do it. Praise be to the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.b;No, this sounds silly, and we do not have the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.desc;The powerful men and women of ancient Egypt often planted palm trees not just for their dates, but to provide good shade in their palaces and temples. I feel as if it would be wise if I did the same to my residence and the nearby temples. If anything, I can show many my power and remind them of the splendor of the old Egyptians!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.a;Let us plant the trees, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.b;Perhaps I should not, this seems vain and pointless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4152.desc;An important and influential member of the local community in your capital has given you an beautifully crafted gold amulet dedicated to the god Khnum. As controller of the Nile, he brings fortune to all and is not to be ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4152.a;Thank you! May this amulet help me in this life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.desc;Ill news! Lately it seems a crafty band of robbers have been breaking into various tombs in [Root.GetName], desecrating corpses and making away with whatever riches they can find. How now will the dead be able to properly protect their descendants, much less live contentedly in the afterlife with Osiris? This is a shame, indeed, and nothing but a shame!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.a;Hopefully local security will catch these brigands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.b;We will provide some aid to protect any unplundered tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4154.desc;In my dream I was surrounded by evil spirits. I was lost. I was scared. I fell to despair, I lost hope. But then came the god Bes, that dwarf-god of grotesque appearance, and I saw him as he took out his swords and knives and waved them like a soldier, to ward off the demons. I saw as he took out his musical instruments and played loud songs to frighten them. As I awoke, I felt at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4154.a;As he protected the Pharaohs of old, so has he protected me just now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.desc;I feel that despite my many good deeds, there are is still Isfet- evil -within me that must be purged, for I have certainly done sinful things as a ruler. If my heart is out of balance with Ma'at, then in the afterlife I will be devoured by the terrible beast Ammit and I will have no chance of a peaceful immortality. Thus, I desire to find a good sorcerer-priest, who knows how to alleviate me of this worry!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.a;I must ensure my place in the afterlife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.b;On second thought, all this talk of "evil" and the afterlife is stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.tooltip;Off to the temple we go.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.title;Expel the Evil in my Heart;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.desc;The sorcerer-priest understands my worries, and knows the right incantation for my situation. He thus begins to chant in my presence:\n\n"I am bringing the gods incense and natron.\nI want to expel the bad smell from your mouth.\nTherefore I come in order to expel the evil in your hearts.\nWith this I remove the Evil, Isfet, which clings to you.\nWith this I bring you Good.\nI present Justice, Ma'at, to you......";;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.a;I begin to feel relieved as my soul is cleansed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4157.desc;The peasants you rule over believe that no matter what hardships they face, your rule has maintained the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm. They praise you for your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4157.a;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4158.desc;Regardless of whether they are right or wrong, the peasants you rule over believe that due to your style of rule, you unfortunately have been unable to maintain the balance of Ma'at- justice, goodness, the natural order -in the realm. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4158.a;They don't understand! Don't understand at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4159.desc;To honor the traditions of the ancient Egyptians, many women in the region have taken to adopting holy cats, for they represent feminine fertility and sensuality. One day while lounging with your wife, you notice she is playing with one of her cats, and you can't help but notice as she watches you she is looking at you in a rather seductive, cat-like manner, and suddenly you feel as if you want to learn more about this cat-like fertility and sensuality in a more practical, hands-on sense...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4159.a;Come here, kitty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.desc;A heinous crime! The wretched criminal is brought before you, and few in your court can bear to look at the deviant, lawless, inhuman evil-doer. He will be punished severely for his deed, of course, that is without a doubt. You tell the man his sentence, and your guards take him away to execute him shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.a;Terrible! To think he murdered a cat, even by accident! An unforgivable crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.b;Come now, it's just a cat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_stupid_cat_lovers_boooo;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4161.desc;Ancient texts describe how in old Egypt, women were viewed as having greater amount of rights, privileges, and opportunities than they do today. Or so I've been told. Perhaps I should treat the women of my court with more respect if I am to properly emulate the customs of ancient Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4162.desc;A courtier has challenged me to a game of Senet. This ancient game has been played in Egypt ever since recorded history, and I like to think that while I'm not the best at it, I can still hold my own.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4163.desc;I have challenged my liege to a game of Senet. This ancient game has been played in Egypt ever since recorded history, and I like to think that while I'm not the best at it, I can still hold my own.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4163.a;Let's see who wins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4164.tooltip;You win;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4164.desc;I've been beaten me in Senet! A humiliating defeat, but a well-deserved one.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4164.b;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4165.tooltip;You lose;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4165.desc;I have won the Senet match. Clearly the Gods have favored me!;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4166.desc;Your courtier claims that while taking a walk today he was by himself and encountered the ghost of Akhenaten himself! This abominable heretic, an incompetent Pharaoh obsessed with the god Aten, caused much mayhem in old Egypt and was rightfully cursed by the priests once the old, true religion was restored. But this is not good news... has your courtier been cursed as well?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4166.a;Better get to the priests quickly, dear friend, just in case!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4167.desc;You watch solemnly as the criminal is beheaded. Off goes his head, and his blood spills to the ground. Shezmu, the demon-god known as the Overthrower of the Wicked at the Block, the Slaughterer of Souls, and the Lord of Blood, must be pleased. They say when the condemned are executed, he throws their severed heads into a wine press and turns it into red wine.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4167.a;Righteous red wine! I think I'll have some later today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_heard_about_apollo_prank_desc;This character has heard a funny story about a prank a god supposedly pulled on another one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.desc;The story of Proserpina’s abduction by Pluto has interested you as of late. Pluto seems like a calm, stoic type who justly dispenses judgment over the souls of the dead without bias and isn’t a philanderer like his brothers, so you wonder as to why he would have acted so rashly. Is there more to the story than meets the eye?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.a;Nah, it was as they say. He had his way with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.b;Maybe Pluto conspired with Proserpina and the abduction was an excuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.c;Perhaps a poet exaggerated the story for unnecessary drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.d;Sometimes I wonder what sort of history Pluto and Ceres had...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.tooltip.1;\n\nThat mischievous Cupid is to blame, having shot the arrow that made Pluto obsessed. Proserpina was beautiful and Pluto was lonely and desperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.tooltip.2;\n\nOr maybe the two of them conspired with Ceres! Who knows - maybe they needed to protect Proserpina from the philandering Jupiter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.tooltip.3;\n\nAfter all, Pluto is one of the most faithful Gods, so he doesn't seem the type to kidnap fair maidens. Maybe Pluto was just socially awkward but the poets wanted a more sensational story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2500.tooltip.4;\n\nWhat if Ceres secretly loved Pluto? What if her anguish at losing her daughter was actually anguish at her unrequited love for Pluto, but she was too embarrassed to admit it so she made up the story about Prosperina’s abduction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2501.tooltip.0;\n\nShe probably knows best after all and it would be improper if not blasphemous of me to make arbitrary assumptions about her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2501.desc;You ponder on the stories surrounding Apollo and Diana and how protective they were of one another. Orion died because Apollo feared Diana would break her vow of chastity. Meanwhile, Diana killed Apollo's lover Coronis when she cheated on him. It sounds like a kind of jealousy snd protectiveness, doesn’t it? You start to wonder whether the twins are closer than they appear... ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2501.a;Nah, probably just siblings who care about each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2501.b;Aha! Diana's “virgin” status makes much more sense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2501.c;Haha, that's a good one. What are we, Zoroastrians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2501.d;Maybe I could ask the goddess herself, since she likes me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2502.tooltip;\n\nI would like to, ah, have a more hands-on demonstration of what transpired between her and Jupiter. For the sake of fair judgement, of course. But not when her husband is around, of course. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2502.desc;A local nobleman recently accused his wife of adultery. He says her newborn child is not his. She claims, however, that Lord Jupiter came down from the heavens and had his way with her and that while she did not want to be unfaithful, it would have been unwise for her to resist the powerful god. She is an extremely attractive young woman, so it wouldn't be impossible… right? Unable to resolve the dispute, they come to you for judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2502.a;I'm sorry, but how is this supposed to be my problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2502.b;Haha, good one. Adulteresses have always used that excuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2502.c;Clearly this is a child of Jupiter! Treat him well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2502.d;Why doesn’t she show me what Jupiter did to her…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2503.desc;While visiting a town you notice a beggar's corpse lying by the road. The locals said he recently died but otherwise ignore the corpse, saying someone will clean it up eventually. You notice the poor beggar doesn't even have the two coins needed to give to Charon in the afterlife so that he may be able to travel to the underworld without hassle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2503.a;I will give the corpse two of my own gold pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2503.b;It's not my business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2504.desc;A man comes to your residence, asking to let him stay the night. His face is kindly but he wears the tattered, ragged clothes of a vagrant. As a follower of the gods it is your duty to show Xenia, or hospitality, but realistically speaking he could be a troublemaking hoodlum or even an assassin for all you know...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2504.a;We must show Xenia. Let him in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2504.b;Be rid of him. What if he's a thief?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2505.desc;In a dream, the king of gods, Jupiter, appears before you. Thunderclouds surround him and he is angry. "How dare you refuse me, arrogant swine! Have you forgotten Xenia?" You recoil in horror, realizing that beggar you rudely turned away was Jupiter in disguise!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2505.a;Have mercy! Don't curse me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2506.desc;In a dream, the king of gods, Jupiter, appears before you. He sits on a throne, smiling. As you supplicate before him, he says, "You were wise to show hospitality to me. You know Xenia, mortal." You realize that the beggar you accepted into your abode was Jupiter in disguise!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2506.a;Oh thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2507.desc;While taking a walk you come across some maidens bathing in the stream. Embarrassed, you try to sneak away but they notice you. Giggling, they call you over, and you can't help but be entranced by their beauty and their sweet voices.... Ah! They must be local nymphs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2507.a;Don't mind if I join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2507.b;No. I am loyal to my beloved and will resist the temptation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2507.c;I have no interest with these giggly airheads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2507.d;I will entertain you, but no naughty business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2508.desc;You come by a village engaging in the “pharmakos” ceremony, wherein a chosen man- usually a criminal, beggar, cripple, slave, or some other undesirable -is ritually beaten and then exiled. The village recently went through some rough times, and the ceremony will supposedly help the villagers gain the favor of the gods and restore their fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2508.a;Interesting. Carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2508.b;Stop this! This is clearly a silly superstition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2509.desc;One of your servants discovered a so-called “curse tablet” lying in a grave near your residence. Alarmingly, the writing on the tablet was an invocation of the dead spirits of the grave, as well as the gods of the underworld- Pluto and Proserpina -to bring misery and misfortune upon you. You have the priests properly dispose of the item, but you can’t help but feel uneasy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2509.a;Oh no! Heavens have mercy on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2509.b;It’s just mere superstition at the end of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2509.c;There is nothing to fear from some stupid piece of writing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.desc;You recently discovered one of your maids trying to write a binding spell addressed to Venus - a love spell, in other words. Surprisingly, the spell targeted you. She wanted you, her lord, to fall in love with her! Though binding spells are typically thought of as something men would do, it is not unheard of for women to try using them. And your beautiful maid is young, naive, and at your complete mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.a;This is ridiculous. Why do I put up with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.b;You know, you’re very pretty, and I can teach you many things, darling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.c;She shall be punished for this witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.d;I’m flattered, but I am your lord and you are a mere maid. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.tooltip.1;\n\nHer face is beet red as she promises not to make anymore trouble, and you both agree to pretend this never happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.tooltip.2;\n\nSeems like her love spell worked after all. And there’s nothing like seducing an innocent virgin and making her all yours.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.tooltip.3;\n\nWho knows what other crazy things she might be doing?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.tooltip.4;\n\nYou gently tell her that she is being silly. “Someday you’ll find a good husband,” you tell her in a brotherly tone. “I can help you find one in the future, if you want.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2510.tooltip.5;\n\nYou gently tell her that she is being silly. “Someday you’ll find a good husband,” you tell her in a fatherly tone. “I can help you find one in the future, if you want.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2511.desc;You recently discovered one of your young servant boys trying to write a binding spell addressed to Venus - a love spell, in other words. Surprisingly, the spell targeted you. He wanted you to fall in love with him! You didn’t expect this from him, as he is shy and gentle, so it seems he learned about these spells from older peers. And your handsome servant is young, naive, and at your complete mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2511.a;This is ridiculous. Why do I put up with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2511.b;You know, you’re very cute, and I can teach you many things, darling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2511.c;He shall be punished for this witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.2512.desc;One of your prisoners - an insignificant, elderly peasant - was starving and frail due to his advanced age and the conditions of his confinement, but his young daughter snuck into the prison every night, breastfeeding him so he could survive. For such a display of pietas, filial duty, many in your court say that the father should be given a pardon! The gods would be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2512.a;Yes. Clearly the gods have blessed them. Release him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2512.b;Yes - and furthermore, I will give them public support for life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2512.c;No. I do not care what the gods think. The law will not allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2512.d;No. What more, I shall execute them for their disrespect to my authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2513.desc;Rumors abound that a powerful nymph resides in one of your realm’s provinces. She was said to once be the wife and lover of a kind and wise lord who once ruled the area. Though he, a mortal, has since long passed, her spirit remains to this day and blesses the province every now and then with fortune and abundance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2513.a;Interesting… maybe I’ll get to meet her one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2514.desc;A courtier comes before you, asking for intervention in a family dispute. Apparently his son is a devout worshipper of Cybele, the great mother goddess. Like many of her followers, the son wishes to castrate himself and serve her for the rest of his life as a Galli, the castrated priests of Cybele. However, the father says that it is the son's duty to continue the family line.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2514.a;The father is right. Filial duty is as important as proper worship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2514.b;The son is right. His faith is admirable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2514.c;They should ask an oracle for advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2515.desc;Near your capital a new village is being founded, and you are attending the opening ceremony. The villagers make a hole, the leptis manialis, said to represent the gateway to the underworld, and one that is dug each time a village is founded. As the highest ranking dignitary, you are the first to leave an offering of fruit in the hole.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2515.a;May the gods bless this town for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2516.desc;One of your courtiers, while out hunting, seems to have accidentally killed an animal in one of Diana's sacred groves! The man is afraid of divine retribution.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2516.a;Pray to Diana for mercy and admit your mistakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2516.b;Probably not a big deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2517.desc;An important nobleman in your realm has recently married a great beauty who seems to have appeared out of nowhere. She is graceful and kind, clever and friendly, and claims to be a noblewoman from elsewhere. Rumor has it that she was a local nymph who fell in love with the him and decided to take on the form of a mortal woman! What a lucky fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2517.a;He must have pleased Venus and Cupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2518.desc;Lightning recently struck one of the trees on your residence. It was an otherwise clear day with nary a sign of cloud or rain. Your soothsayers say that this was clearly a sign from the gods, which they then interpreted as a good omen. Your courtiers have already begun to treat the tree as a “fanaticus,” a sacred tree blessed by the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2518.a;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2519.desc;The ancient Latins regarded the ancient hero Ulysses as nothing more than a coward who manipulated and deceived those around him. The ancient Hellenes, on the other hand, who knew him as Odysseus, believed that his cunning was an admirable trait showing his resourcefulness and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2519.a;The Latins are right: Ulysses is a chicken-hearted liar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2519.b;The Greeks are right: Odysseus is brave and intelligent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2519.c;Who cares? He’s long dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2520.tooltip;\n\nAnd unlike his philandering brothers, Pluto is a good and faithful husband, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2520.desc;One of your courtiers is extremely drunk. So drunk, in fact, that he suddenly declares that he shall rescue Prosperina from the evil Pluto! Everyone rolls their eyes at such blasphemy. The courtier then asks you, his liege, to assist him in this effort. Together, you both will travel to the underworld and save Prosperina from her dark husband. You shake your head and tell him to watch his mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2520.a;No one insults the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2521.desc;You have angered Pluto and Prosperina with your blasphemous claims!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2521.a;Oh no! I don’t want to go to Tartarus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2522.title;Hades Aidoneus;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2522.desc;In your dreams, a man and woman appear before you. They are dark and brooding, but do not seem malevolent. The woman is young - barely an adult - and has golden tresses that frames her pale, beautiful face. The man is tall and stern, lean and handsome.\n\nHe speaks first: “Your friend shall be punished for his blasphemous proclamation. Only a fool tries to steal my wife from the underworld, and he shall suffer in Tartarus. But you rightly warned him. For your wisdom, I, Lord Pluto, and my wife, Queen Prosperina, shall grant you our blessings.”\n\nThe next morning, your courtier is found dead for no apparent reason.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2522.a;Lord Pluto is just… my courtier’s hubris led to his downfall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2522.b;I hope Prosperina will appeal to Pluto for mercy on my courtier’s soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2522.c;It was just a dream. I am sure someone killed him to silence his blasphemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2523.desc;You are sitting with your courtiers, having idle conversation. They are discussing the Trojan War and how it all started when Venus, Juno, and Minerva competed to see which one of them was the loveliest of all. Your courtiers begin debating which of the three goddesses was truly the most beautiful. Paris may have chosen Venus, but who would you have chosen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2523.a;Venus of course. She's the goddess of beauty after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2523.b;Juno, I think. A true beauty is regal and maternal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2523.c;Minerva in my opinion. Intelligence is very attractive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2523.d;I'm a woman. Why should I care? Stupid men and their fantasies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2523.e;I don't care. Now between Apollo, Jupiter, or Mars, I'd choose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2524.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, a woman appears before you. She is physically perfect - from her body to her face to the aura that emanates from her - and every part of her is desirable. She is no doubt Venus, goddess of love and beauty, and you prostrate before her. She laughs and tells you that you made the right choice is saying she was the most beautiful of all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2524.a;“To think Juno and Minerva could compete with me, the goddess of beauty!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2525.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, a woman appears before you. She is beautiful, but in a dignified manner befitting that of a queen. Queen? You realize that she is none other than Juno, queen of the gods! As you bow to her, she says that she was rather pleased when you said that she was the most beautiful of all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2525.a;“Indeed, Venus and Minerva are but silly little girls!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2526.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, a woman appears before you. She is a young maiden of incomparable beauty. She wears a full suit of armor, and wields a spear. You realize that she is the great Minerva! As you pay your respects, she explains that you were wise in arguing that she was the most beautiful of all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2526.a;“That Venus is such a bimbo, you know that?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2527.desc;Someone suggested that I build some more herma in the area around my residence. In olden days, the herma were a rectangular column with the head of a deity on top (usually Hermes) and a phallus carved into the column. They are said to bring good luck and fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2527.a;Yes, good idea - we’ll show our devotion to Hermes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2527.b;Phallic statues? Are you kidding me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2528.desc;While visiting a local town my entourage and I pass by a large statue of Priapus, the old god of fertility. Like most statues of the god, he is depicted an oversized, exaggerated member, everyone is supposed to touch in order to call for the god’s blessings. If anyone angered Priapus, it is said that he would threaten to sexually assault them, regardless of gender or age or background.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2528.a;I duly touch the statue’s phallus and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2528.b;Ew, I am not touching that disgusting thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2529.desc;Every now and then you pay homage to your family’s Lares, the local guardian deities who have protected your dynasty since time immemorial. It is important you honor them with sacrifices and offerings, so that they may provide help in times of need. You approach the lararium, the shrine where the small statue of the Lar is placed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2529.a;Salve lar familiaris!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2550.desc;You are out hunting one day in the woods when you hear someone up ahead. Curious, you push aside the green leaves of some bushes, and behold a most wondrous sight. Before you is a woman of unearthly beauty bathing naked in a stream. Her long, dark brown hair gently curls downwards, but does little to hide her flawless porcelain skin, the soft curves of her body, or her pretty face.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2550.a;You notice a bow and arrow lying nearby. Is she a hunter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2551.tooltip;\n\nWait a moment…. Hunter… goddess...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2551.title;The Virgin Goddess;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2551.desc;You’re frozen - whether out of admiration or fear, you know not - as the woman notices your presence and turns to face you. Her beauty is impossible - she IS a goddess! She sighs and brings her palm to her face, and mutters, “Why do the Fates keep sending these mortals stumbling into me while I’m bathing?”\n\nShe straightens herself and proclaims loudly, “I am Diana, virgin goddess of the hunt! Who dares trespass?”\n\nYou immediately look down, afraid. You don’t want to end up like the unfortunate Actaeon. The next words to come out of your mouth could determine your fate…;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2551.a;Beg for mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2551.b;Charm and persuade her with clever words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2551.c;Proudly boast of your power to impress her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_artemis_response_possibility;\n\n(Chance of succeeding, dying, or surviving but injured.);;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2552.desc;Your words do not move the goddess, who glares at you with murderous rage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2552.a;Wait, no, have mercy! I didn’t mean to. Oh, no, crap, crap, crap -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2552.b;At least the last thing I see before I die is a naked beauty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2553.desc;Your words do not seem to please Diana, who merely watches you, fuming. Next thing you know, you’re lying on the ground, wounded, head hurting. Still, you’re alive, and look around but see nothing. Is the goddess gone? Before you can process what happened, however, you hear her voice: “Be lucky that I spared you, unlike Actaeon. Let your injury will be a reminder of your transgression.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2553.a;You mutter a prayer and thank her for her mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2554.title;Divine Mercy;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2554.desc;You begin nervously: “Lady Diana, it is not every day that one comes across such a great goddess. I was but hunting in these parts when I stumbled onto you by accident. I beseech you to not let me suffer the same fate as that fool Actaeon. I will not mention this to anyone, and I will forever be your loyal follower, and only ask that you have mercy on me this day.”\n\nA moment’s silence. Tension.\n\nFinally, she snorts. “I’ve heard better groveling, but you could have done worse. You know your place, and, having supplicated properly to me, I shall protect you in return so long as you do not tell anyone of our meeting lest you wish to suffer my wrath.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2554.a;You thank the goddess, and prepare to leave, but she stops you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2555.title;Polumetis;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2555.desc;It is a risk to sweet talk your way out of this, but desperate times call for desperate measures. “Mighty Diana! My punishment is great indeed, for I shall never be able to gaze on such beauty of a goddess again. It is more a punishment that all mortal women I meet will never compare to you in loveliness, that all mortal men I meet will never compare to you in power and strength. It is a punishment that I have accidentally offended the very goddess who I admire for she has skill in hunting and war far exceeding my own! These are punishments to drive a man mad, surely, incomparable goddess!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2555.a;She is silent. That can’t be good…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2556.title;The Charmer;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2556.desc;Suddenly, you hear laughter. The goddess tells you to stand up and look at her. When you refuse, she tells you she has put her clothes on so it is alright.\n\nFearful, but not wanting to disobey, you look up and gaze at her. She now wears a simple, humble white peplos, which does nothing to hide her majestic beauty. She smirks as she tells you, “You mortals think Olympians such as myself are a vengeful lot, but I can appreciate your wit, even if it is insincere flattery. You certainly have more charm than that fool Actaeon. Very well, I shall spare you.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2556.a;You stand awkwardly, wondering what she will do with you now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2557.title;Goddess of the Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2557.desc;“Tell me, mortal,” she asks, “What is your name?”\n\n“I am [Root.GetTitledFirstName],” you say.\n\n“Ah! I have heard of you and your deeds, and I see that you bear yourself like a lord and ruler of men. So you are hunting, I see. As it so happens I was hunting in these parts as well and resting for a bit until I was… rudely interrupted by a pervert.” She smirks as you squirm uncomfortably. “It seems that the Fates have decided for us - two hunters - to meet here and now. Why not join me and show me your skill?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2557.a;Afraid of offending her further, you accept her invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2558.title;Moon Above, Voice Within;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2558.desc;You spend the rest of the afternoon hunting with Diana, and she teaches you many things. Before you two part, she promises to give you her protection, so long as you do not tell anyone about the whole incident, and you feel as if she thinks of you as a friend. When you emerge from the forest that evening, you wonder whether the entire incident had been a dream. However, as you look up to the moon, you feel a strange sense of peace and majesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2558.a;You salute the moon and continue back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2559.desc;Even though it's been a while, you still offer a small sacrifice to Diana every now and then. You're not quite sure if the whole incident was a dream, but better safe than sorry. On the altar, you place the corpse of a dead animal you recently killed while hunting. Hopefully this will please her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2559.a;She’s the goddess of the hunt, after all, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2560.title;Enough Animal Carcasses!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2560.desc;That night, Diana appears to you in your dreams. She is on her throne, which is colored silver like the moon and has the pelt of a deer, her sacred animal, draped over it. She sits casually, resting her chin on a palm while she dangles the remains of your sacrifice from her other hand. You fear you have somehow offended her with your sacrifice. Apparently as if she read your mind, she says, “Calm yourself, I’m not going to hurt you. Gods, you mortals think we’re always trying to kill you. Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that you don’t need to give me dead animals all the time.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2560.a;Why? I thought you were goddess of the hunt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2560.b;Your wish is my command! But what can I give you instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2561.title;Baklava Sacrifice;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2561.desc;“Dead animals are fine, but it’s tiring when mortals give you that all the time, not to mention we already hunt them together every now and then, so what’s the point in giving me more? What about cakes? Pastries? Pies? Cookies?” Suddenly her eyes light up with joy, her hands clap together, and her voice becomes giddy with excitement, as if she were a child. “How about baklava? Apollo gave me some a while back and by Olympus it was heavenly! You mortals come up with the best foods. Yes. You will sacrifice… er… offer me this baklava. Of course I would still prefer you give me some of the animals you hunted every now and then, but whoever came up with the idea that I only like animal carcasses forgets that a girl needs to eat sweets every now and then, no?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2561.a;I understand. I will remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2562.title;Sol Invictus;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2562.desc;You are dreaming again, and before you stands a handsome young man. He is somewhat tanned, with golden hair and a lean but well-built body. He holds a lyre in his hand, and greets you. “I am Apollo, god of the sun, prophecy, music, the arts, and so on and so on. I have heard that my virgin sister has befriended you!”\n\nShe considers you a friend now? That’s very humbling. But wait a moment… why is Apollo coming here?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2562.a;He doesn’t think… wait, I’m not like Orion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2563.title;Phoebus Apollo;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2563.desc;“Oh, worry not, mortal,” Apollo said, noticing the fear on your face, “I see that Diana does not regard you the same way as she regarded Orion. However, this is just a friendly warning - if you do anything to make her suffer, then know that my wrath on you shall be greater than hers. I am her brother, and her closest confidante, and it would pain me to see her hurt.”\n\nHe pauses, and grins. “Now, that aside, it is a pleasure to see you in person at last. Even if in a dream. I can see why my sister is fond of you.  And she needs more friends, anyways, she needs to learn to be more sociable. Regardless, as she has offered her protection, so shall I, for though it may not always be apparent, I see in you a kind of greatness and virtue.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2563.a;Thank you, o Lord Apollo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2564.tooltip;\n\nAs you wake up and reflect on the dream, you wonder about the relationship between the twin deities. They seem awfully close to one another. You decide to ask Diana about it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2564.title;Moon and Sun;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2564.desc;In your prayers to Diana you ask her whether she and Apollo have a… “special” kind of sibling relationship. The next night, in your dream, she appears to you and the first thing she does is punch you in the face, making you fall down. Afterwards, she helps you up and apologizes for the unwarranted violence. She then adds, “Don’t even think about it, understand? I am.. er… a virgin goddess after all, it’s… it’s not like I care about my brother or anything.”\n\nHer face is completely neutral, though you swear you can see a smile on her face, and is that a slight blush on her cheeks?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2564.a;“Anyways, I’m not mad, it’s just you’re not the first person to ask me that.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_apollo_is_a_baka;“I actually made a bet with my brother about when you'd ask, since most of my favored followers ask eventually. Apollo won, of course, since I tend to forget he's the god of prophecy.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2565.desc;Your devotion to Diana is not without its benefits. For instance, you feel like she has inspired you to become a more virtuous person.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2565.a;Praise be to the virgin goddess of the hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2566.desc;You are out hunting and get separated from your main party. You are frustrated and muttering curses under your breath as you try to find your way back, and do not notice someone standing in front of you. You bump into the person. “Who are…” Your eyes widen in shock as she stands before you. “Lady Diana!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2566.a;“It’s been a while, mortal,” she says with a grin. “Care to go hunting with me?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2567.desc;You spend the rest of the day hunting with Diana and you learn a lot from her again. You realize that she seems to be fond of you. Not a romantic kind of fondness, of course, but a kind of respect. She says she wants to hunt with you every now and then as she enjoys your company, and reassures you that she will continue to provide you protection in exchange for your prayers and offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2567.a;I am most humbled, Lady Diana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2568.desc;In the midst of battle, you were knocked down by an enemy warrior. He would have struck you down and killed you right then and there had it not been for an arrow that flew out of nowhere and hit the unfortunate man straight through the neck, killing him instantly. You look around, but it doesn’t seem like the arrow came from any of your men. “You owe me,” comes the goddess Diana’s voice in your head.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2568.a;Oh! Praise Diana! Thank you for saving my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2569.title;A Female Perspective;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2569.desc;You are out hunting with Diana once more as you do every now and then. You're telling her about your recent relationship troubles with your wife and you want her advice.\n\nShe crosses her arms and looks at you incredulously. "In case you didn't notice, I'm a sworn virgin. I'm not the goddess of marriage. And as you well know other than Pluto and Prosperina and a few others we Olympians don't always have stable marriages. I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask."\n\n"You're a woman though, Lady Diana,” you explain. “I merely seek a female perspective.";;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2569.a;She presses a palm to her face, exasperated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2570.title;Marriage Counseling;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2570.desc;"Apollo comes to me for advice on women all the time given he has a tendency to fall in and out of love constantly," Diana sighs, "and I do not mind helping my loyal followers every now and then, but might I remind you that I a sworn virgin with little experience in these matters? Very well, I can try my best as long as you promise to give me a lot of baklava next time you give me an offering."\n\n"I can definitely do that, great Diana!"\n\n"Alright. Tell me, what troubles you?";;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2570.a;The two of you discuss your marital problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2571.tooltip;Her advice doesn’t work!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2571.desc;When you next meet Diana, in your dream, you tell her that her advice didn’t work. She shrugs and tells you, “It was worth a try. But remember, just because I’m one doesn’t mean I know everything about women.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2571.a;She pats you on the shoulder in sympathy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2572.tooltip;Her advice works!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2572.desc;When you next meet Diana, in a dream, you tell her about how her advice worked like charm - in fact, it worked better than you expected! She appears surprised for a moment, before saying, “I did not expect that to work… I honestly said things off the top of my head. As I said before, I’m not the goddess of marriage. I’m happy things worked out, though.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2572.a;I am happy as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2573.title;Gemini;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2573.desc;"Do you fight with Apollo a lot?" you suddenly ask Diana one day. The two of you are resting by a river after having spent many hours hunting.\n\n"Why do you ask?"\n\n"Sometimes I get into fights with my sibling. Things can get heated."\n\nShe looks up to the sky, where the sun shines brightly above. "Apollo and I are  immortal. If my brother and I argue we always will reconcile eventually. I cannot stay mad at him forever. I suppose you don’t have that luxury.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2573.a;“Do you love him?” you ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2574.desc;“Of course I do, he is my only full brother. We came into this world together, and we belong together, in a way. I mean that as siblings you’re stuck together whether you like it or not.” She straightens herself. “Your sibling may be annoying, they may even be your worst enemy sometimes, but there's always a bond between you two that cannot be easily broken whatsoever.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2574.a;Thank you for your counsel, Lady Diana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2575.desc;Today I went out hunting with Diana again. It’s always a nice experience. I always learn a lot from her - she is the goddess of the hunt after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2575.a;Good to see you again, my goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2576.desc;The pain from your injury is unbearable and draining, to the point where you don’t even notice a beautiful woman suddenly appearing by your side. She smiles as she places a hand over your wound. “Diana!” you exclaim, realizing who is there. Before you know it, she is gone and your wound is healed. The physicians say it was a miraculous recovery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2576.a;No one recalls seeing the goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2577.desc.a;I sit in the prison cell, miserable. Suddenly, I hear a noise, and the guards nearby have been knocked unconscious. Before I can investigate what happened, a beautiful woman with moon-pale skin and eyes the color of midnight blue appears. “It’s pathetic that I have to come in here to rescue you,” Diana says, grinning. “I expected you to break out yourself, but looks like I have to help you.”;;;;;;;;;;;x

Before I can investigate what happened, a beautiful woman with moon-pale skin and eyes the color of midnight blue appears. “It’s pathetic that I have to come in here to rescue you, you know,” Diana says, grinning. “This isn’t the first time I have to save you, right, mortal?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2577.a;Looks like I owe you one, huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2577.b;It is my duty as your friend to annoy you like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2578.desc;Impossible! [FROM.GetTitledName] somehow escaped from your prisons. Your guards say that someone - a beautiful woman with inhuman grace and strength - somehow entered and helped him break out of jail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2578.a;Did my prisoner have some kind of otherworldly help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2579.desc;You’re out hunting with Diana today and she seems to be in a bad mood. As the two of you take a break and rest in a small clearing, you decide to risk it and ask if anything is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2579.a;I’m her champion, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2580.title;Stupid Poets;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2580.desc;Diana grimaces as she tells about how Apollo gave her some literature various poets have written about her, which he apparently does every now and then to annoy her. “I hate all poets,” she mutters, in conclusion, “except my brother, of course.”\n\nYou nod sympathetically as she sighs.\n\n“They all think I’m some man-hating, lesbian loner just because I’m a sworn virgin. I don’t mess with my nymphs nor have I touched Minerva in ‘that way’ and if I hated men so much then why do I care about my brother? For that matter, why would I be hunting with you, my champion, if I hated men?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2580.a;Those poets don’t know what you’re really like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2581.title;Stories;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2581.desc;She conjures some scrolls from out of nowhere. “This was the ‘literature’ Apollo gave me. I have no use for these, and Minerva doesn’t want them, so I want you to take them and do with them as you wish.”\n\nWhen you give her a questioning look, she says, “I figured you might find them amusing. Or burn them for all I care, I just don’t want to see them again. These poets and musicians and writers, they’re so… cruel. The only god who has it worse than me is Pluto, I think. Poor Pluto. Gods above, all this talk is making me miserable again, let’s continue our hunt so I can forget about this.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2581.a;Um… right, got it. (You keep the scrolls.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2581.b;Um… right, got it. (You burn the scrolls.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2582.desc;You’ve spent enough time with Diana as her hunting companion. It seems that her fondness for you has extended to fondness of your realm, which is beginning to flourish and thrive due to her protection and help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2582.a;Well, that’s good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2583.desc;Though you take care not to tell people much about your odd friendship of sorts with Diana, the goddess of the hunt, inevitably rumors have spread. These rumors tend to be good, suggesting how you are a pious, righteous ruler beloved by the gods. However, a few of the things the poets have said about your relationship with Diana are… interesting, for lack of better wording.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2583.a;I hope she doesn’t hear about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2584.tooltip;\n\nOh what am I kidding, of course she’s heard about them. I just hope she doesn’t take it out on me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2584.title;Such Interesting Literature;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2584.desc;One day you’re sitting in your study alone. You’re taking a break and reading some of the stories that have been written about you and Diana. Such ‘literature’ tends to be pedestrian, produced for the vulgar masses, but it’s interesting to see how the commoners conceive of your relationship with Diana. You are so engrossed in reading that you do initially not realize someone standing next to you, tapping her foot on the floor impatiently for you to notice her.\n\n“Ahem,” Diana finally says, arms crossed.\n\nWithout even looking up, you casually tell her,“Lady Diana, if I may, I suggest you not barge in someone’s private quarters randomly.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2584.a;“And what about when you barged in on me bathing?” she asks simply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2585.title;Bored Goddess;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2585.desc;You turn around. “Fair point. Anyways, you usually don’t visit me in my house… actually you rarely do that. To what pleasure do I owe your appearance?”\n\n“I’m bored,” she says. You snort to yourself, realizing that the lukewarm expression on her face makes her look more like a spoiled mortal princess than the powerful deity she is. “What are you reading?” she asks.\n\n“Oh… er… this….” You wonder whether you should tell her, but realize she’ll figure out anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2585.a;“Stories they’ve written about you,” you reply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2586.title;Why Do These Exist?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2586.desc;You watch her nervously as she skims over the stories. After she finishes and puts the scrolls and books down, she calmly grimaces, though you can tell her eyes are ablaze with fury. “Goddamn poets! Every time I’m friendly with a man they think I’m sleeping with him. Am I sleeping with you? No, I don’t think so. Not that there’s anything wrong with you, but I’m a sworn virgin. Is it that hard for me to be friendly with a man? And they portray me as so vengeful and angry and irrational.”\n\nShe takes a deep breath and calms down. “So, what do you think of these ‘romances’ they’ve written? Why are you even reading them in the first place?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2586.a;“Curiosity? They’re kind of funny - ”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2587.title;Unrealistic Fiction;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2587.desc;Diana glares at you. “Funny? You think these are funny?”\n\n“They’re funny because they’re based on ridiculous rumors,” you say calmly. Most mortals would have cowered at the sight of an angry Diana, but you’ve known her for long enough now that you can discern between when she’s just being moody and when she’s actually angry enough someone could get hurt.\n\nShe calms down again. “Well… I suppose a few of them were funny in their complete lack of realism. Wait, can I see that one again, the one where there’s a love triangle?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2587.a;You both spend the rest of the afternoon reading, laughing at the nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2588.desc;Although you and Diana often hunt together, sometimes the two of you just take walks in the wilderness and chat about things. Currently, the two of you are sitting by a stream in one of her sacred groves as she is complaining about a prank Mercury and Apollo played on her the other day, when you hear a sudden flash and bang. Instinctively, both of you grab your weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2588.a;Who’s there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2589.title;Diana Isn’t Surprised;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2589.desc;It’s Jupiter! Being a mere mortal, you kneel before the king of the gods. He appears regal and imposing, a king of kings yet his voice betrays his nervousness. “Pardon me for the intrusion, I was just passing - ”\n\n“Juno found out about another one of your dalliances and she’s mad now, isn’t she?” Diana asks.\n\n“Oh no, I just wanted to spend time with my favorite daughter - ”\n\n“We all know that Minerva is your favorite. Now leave me and my friend, father, I won’t defend you. As amusing as it might be I don’t want to get in the middle of another fight between you and your wife. Last time I nearly got a head wound.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2589.a;He grumbles and disappears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2590.title;How Annoying;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2590.desc;After Jupiter leaves, Diana scowls. Out of curiosity, you ask her, “Is he more annoying than Apollo?”\n\n“Apollo is the most anno…. No. Apollo is my brother. As much as we annoy each other, we’re still twins. We experienced much together. Father, on the other hand… he needs to learn to control his lust. Sometimes I even consider asking uncle Pluto to lecture to father on how to be a faithful husband.”\n\n“So, anyways, where were we? Oh, right, do continue telling me about what Apollo and Mercury were doing.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2590.a;“So I thought that Apollo was just having sex but actually he…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2591.desc;You and Diana are outside, preparing to go on yet another hunt. You casually observe her as she stretches her muscles and readies her bow, and notices that she seems to be in a good mood. You ask her why, and she starts laughing. “Oh, I should tell you. So you remember what my brother did to me a month ago? Well, I got my revenge. Played prank on him last night.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2591.a;“So I took a statue of Prosperina and spread some hummus by the…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2592.desc;You widen your eyes, shocked at Diana’s creativity. This prank was something you expected from Mercury, not her! You roll on the floor, guffawing with laughter. She’s beaming as well, quite proud of herself. Suddenly, she frowns and her eyes narrow. “He’s probably going to get back at me. I have to remain vigilant, or else…”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2592.a;I promise to help you to the best of my ability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2593.desc;Today Diana was supposed to be hunting with you. However, she brought Apollo along with her. That is usually not a problem - every now and then he joins the two of you - but today it is not going well because the twins started arguing about something stupid, and now you’re sitting awkwardly on the side twiddling your thumbs as they scream and fling childish insults at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2593.a;This isn’t the first time this has happened either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2594.desc;Suddenly, they both turn to you, and ask you for your opinion. Who’s right this time around? You watch them warily. You don’t even know what they’re exactly arguing about, and your opinion is probably irrelevant, but obviously they want to one up each other.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2594.a;As her champion, I must support Lady Diana;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2594.b;For once, Lord Apollo might have a point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2594.c;I think it’s better I somehow appease both…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2595.tooltip.1;\n\nDiana lifts her head proudly in triumph as Apollo sulks. The goddess tries to suppress her laugh at how immature her brother looks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2595.tooltip.2;\n\nDiana stomps a foot on the ground and is about to storm off, but manages to stop and collect herself once she realizes how childish she appears.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2595.tooltip.3;\n\nDiana and Apollo nod sagely, agreeing with the points you raise.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2595.desc;Today while spending some time with Lady Diana, she tells you about how her twin Apollo is frustrating her again. This time it’s because of his sexual escapades. “He’s not as bad as Jupiter,” she admits, “but it’s still rather frustrating. On Mount Olympus his room is next to mine, so I often hear… things. Yesterday he and his lady friend were really loud.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2595.a;He’s a man and can’t help it, but you’re right to be angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2595.b;He should definitely be more considerate to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2596.title;Born Together, Worry Together;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2596.desc;“Thank you for your understanding. But, you know, I don’t want him to get hurt again. He doesn’t have much luck with love, that much of the stories you mortals tell is true. Every time he finds a girl it usually does not end well” She snorts. “I can’t believe I still worry about him that much. Still, I am older, so it's my duty to watch out for him.”\n\n“You’re only older by a few days, right, Lady Diana? Or at least a few hours,” you respond. “That’s not that much older given you’re both immortal. He’s told me that sometimes he feels like the older one when he has to worry about you.”\n\n“Shut up. I’m his older sister.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2596.a;You smile quietly to yourself. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2597.desc;You’re not young anymore, but you still find time to spend with Diana, whether it’s hunting or just relaxing and engaging in dialogue. As her devoted follower, after all, it’s still your duty of sorts. However, lately you’ve been bothered by the fact that you’re no longer the young man you once were. Death ever approaches. You decide to ask Diana about your worries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2597.a;Surely as a deity she might have some insight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2598.title;The Land of Pomegranates;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2598.desc;She frowns as she struggles to formulate an answer. Finally, she says, “I am immortal, you know. I don’t know what it’s like to die.”\n\n“But surely you have seen friends and loved ones die.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know what to say. It’s as foreign a concept to me as my immortality is to you. Don’t worry, though, I’ll make sure to visit you in the underworld after you die, even if you end up in Tartarus,” she says with a smirk. “What, you think my uncle Pluto is a recluse loner? Quite the contrary, we Olympians like to visit his realm every now and then.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2598.a;“Eat the pomegranates when you get there, they’re to die for.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2599.title;Light of the Moon;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2599.desc;Suddenly, you see a light, and a figure appears. It is Diana in full regalia, and armed with her bow and arrow. “You’re dead,” she says as if it’s obvious. “Normally another god would escort you to the underworld, but Pluto allowed me to have the honors.”\n\n“Wait, what - ”\n\n“Come on, I don’t have all day. Do you have your coins for the ferryman? If you don’t you owe me big. Or I could steal a couple of Apollo’s coins instead, as I do need to get back at him. Yesterday he had the gall to come up to me and…. Anyways, I'll tell you later. Don’t worry, I’ll visit you in the underworld every now and then, but I’ve recommended to Pluto that you be placed in Elysium.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.2599.a;“Ah. Well. Thank you, Lady Diana. It’s the end for me, huh?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_artemis_finally_a_lotr_reference;\n\nShe smiles gently. “End? No, my friend, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that you must take.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
