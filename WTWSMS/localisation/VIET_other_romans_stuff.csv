ottoman.1.tt;The Turkish Empire is founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.1.name;A Turkish Empire arises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.1.desc;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], you did what generations of holy warriors failed to do. By conquering Constantinople, you prove yourself a conqueror above all conquerors. The first Rome was Pagan, the second Christian, but now the Third shall be Muslim under the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.1.a;Allahu Akbar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.2.desc;The Byzantine Empire, though it survives, is a mockery of its former glory. Since it has been reduced to such size and since we rule Constantinople, none question our claim to the Roman Empire, save the weak Christian infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.2.a;Allahu Akbar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.3.desc;Our holy war against the heathen Byzantine Empire goes well. Many noble-hearted and brave warriors are joining our cause. Let the Romans tremble in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ottoman.6.name;The Fall of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.6.desc;The great and mighty Turkish warriors have conquered Constantinople! The Muslim world rings with jubilation and celebration from every mosque, for it was Muhammad who said, “Verily he shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader will he be, and what a wonderful army will that army be!”\nThe Turks now have a strong foothold in Europe, and with a claim on the old Roman Empire, Europe trembles with a fear not seen since the days when the Germanic hordes swept down into the Roman Empire. And so it is:\n“The spider weaves the curtains in the palace of the Caesars\nthe owl calls the watches in the towers of Afrasiab.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.6.a;Oh my...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.6.b;Masha’Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ottoman.9.desc;I am the great and mighty [Root.GetTitledFirstName], who has no shortage of beautiful women available to me.

ottoman.9.a;Yes! She deserves no less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.9.b;Then again, this might prove troublesome down the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.10.desc;Sex! Sex! Sex! That's all they want me to do. The members of my harem, my servants, my ministers, my generals, all my subjects, it's like that's all they care about. Why do I have to "prove" my masculinity this way? I can only groan as one of my wives is brought before me for tonight's "activities". Why can't I just send her away and read a good book instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ottoman.10.a;I have to do this, lest my reputation will suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
