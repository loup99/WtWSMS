israel.100.desc;For many years I have ruled over Israel, but always stuck inside the confines of holy Jerusalem, I have found that I know very little of the rest of my realm, particularly the countryside. Today, I decided to take some trusted courtiers and travel north, where the weather might be better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.100.a;I will travel north towards the Galilee!;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.100.tooltip;You travel north to survey your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.101.desc;The north of Israel is beautiful. Unlike the dry and flat center, I've seen forests and orchards, valleys and mountains... truly, I must come here more often. While travelling through the hills of the Galilee, we stumbled upon a village and I proposed that we visit it for refreshment, but our guide advises that it is not a Jewish village, so we may be ill received.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.101.a;Nonsense, I am sure they will receive me well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.101.b;Yes, that sounds prudent. Let us go back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.101.tooltip;You descend upon the village to meet its people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.102.name;A village in the Galilee;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.102.desc;The village is peaceful and quiet, and it seems the peasants devote themselves to dairy farming, judging by all the cows. As my entourage arrives, I can see that some of my companions feel unease with entering a non-Jewish location, a feeling shared by the first villagers to see us. It seems we are likely the first nobility to come here in many years. As I reach the town center, an old man approaches the entourage and is quick to welcomes me to the village. After some initial pleasantries, he invites me inside for a chat. The invitations draws some sneers from those who came with me..;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.102.a;Of course, I am always ready to talk to my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.102.b;Actually, get some water so we can get going.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.102.tooltip;You and the old man exchange words.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.103.name;The Arameans of Israel;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.103.desc;In an interesting twist of fate, it seems I stumbled upon one of the last Aramean communities in the Levant, or so this man, the elder of this village, claims. He tells me of their ancient culture, which goes back to even before ancient Judea, but seems somewhat bitter at how low his people have sunk since the days of David and Solomon. According to him, for centuries their Muslim lords have imposed their way of life on the Arameans, and those of his people who accept Islam quickly turn their backs to their roots and assimilate. It is clear the Aramean community is dwindling perilously close to extinction, and although he remains polite, it is clear my host does not believe the rebirth of Israel will alleviate their plight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.103.a;It seems our stories are not very different...;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.103.b;All stories come to an end, and so will the arameans;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.103.tooltip;The Aramean story gives you much to think about...;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.104.name;The Arameans of Israel;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.104.desc;To celebrate our historical visit, the town quickly arranges a modest but well intentioned feast of cheese, bread, honey and some wine. I notice that while some of my courtiers interact with the locals and enjoy the food, another group has chosen not to partake in the festivities, clearly bothered by our presence in this Aramean village. Still, the story of the Arameans and their plight has stuck in my mind. Our two ancient cultures have much in common, from our history to our goals, so maybe we should stand together. I could use this opportunity to declare the Arameans to be our equals and brothers, but I am sure there will be those among my court and my vassals who will be enraged by this decision..;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.104.a;The Arameans are our brothers, let us stand togheter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.104.b;This is a terrible idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.104.tooltip;You declare your support to the Aramean minority;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.105.desc;As word of the events in the Aramean village spread across the realm, many of my vassals have denounced my decision and refused to recognize it. This will be an uphill battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.105.a;My choice is made.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.106.desc;As the new sovereign and authority in Israel, it falls upon me to determine whether or not I will uphold the laws of my predecessor, one of which is the protection extended to the Arameans of the Galilee. There are those at court who think this should not be an issue, but many who hope I cease this chance to end this policy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.106.a;The Arameans remain under our protection.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.106.b;The Arameans are on their own from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.107.name;Our brothers, the Arameans?;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.107.desc;For many years the Aramean communities of the Galilee have thrived under our rule. Their prowess in education is rivalled only by our Jewish yeshivas, and many of their brightest have distinguished themselves right here, on these halls, tirelessly working for the betterment of Israel. From the day Israel extended its protection to the Aramean people, they have shown unwavering commitment to our shared realm, but still they are not fully equals, as every time a new King rises to the Throne of David, the Aramean’s in the Galilee shiver and wonder if the new King will reaffirm his commitment to their plight. The Arameans have proven themselves, so maybe it is time we respond in kind and turn our friendship into an unbreakable law, all naysayers be damned.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.107.a;It shall be done, we stand toghter, forever.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.107.b;This is not wise.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.108.desc;The Aramean communities in the Galilee sent me a bright man to help me manage the realm, with a promise of friendship and commitment to the protection of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.108.a;Welcome! We need all the bright minds we can get.;;;;;;;;;;;x
israel.108.b;Actually, I have enough administrators.;;;;;;;;;;;x
